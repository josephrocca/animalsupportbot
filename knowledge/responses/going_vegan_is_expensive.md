There is a misconception that vegan food is expensive, and that those who subscribe to this lifestyle are privileged. In any grocery store, the most expensive foods tend to be meat and cheese, while the cheapest foods are beans, rice, potatoes, pasta, lentils, and so forth.

Vegan food can be more expensive when buying substitutes, such as frozen vegan ‘chicken’ nuggets which are still more expensive than non-vegan chicken nuggets. This is due to a variety of reasons, including smaller productions due to lower consumer demand and government subsidies toward the animal agriculture industry, which artificially decreases the value of meat and dairy products[1]. More people choosing to go vegan and purchase these vegan products can contribute to wider market share and help lower their costs.

A vegan diet does not equate to organic products or juice bars, which would also warrant high expenses. It would also be worth noting that the fastest growing vegan demographic is African Americans[2], despite that nearly a quarter of Blacks live in poverty[3]. Veganism does not have to equate to higher costs of food especially on a whole food plant-based diet. After all, production of fruits, beans, and vegetables is much cheaper than any other type of food. The foundation of a good vegan diet is affordable and accessible foods, which are much cheaper than animal products.
