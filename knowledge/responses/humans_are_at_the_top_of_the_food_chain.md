The food chain in nature is important in maintaining healthy populations of animals and ensures a balance in the natural ecology. It is also a consequence of the dynamics of the wild world in which the predator needs to kill the prey to survive. However, once the need to kill for survive is removed from the equation, being stronger is not a justification for killing mindlessly.

Meat and other animal products are not needed for nutrition [1]. In the present day, humans consume animals for sensory pleasure and given the plentitude of alternative food options, animals do not have to be killed to live. Our position as the species on top of the food chain does not necessitate the use of our dominance to kill others. 

Not only are we the most fit, we are also the only ones capable of being moral agents. This means we can weigh the consequences and impact of our actions. We can make decisions based on the notion of right and wrong and most importantly, we can be held accountable for the actions that we make. As the dominant species, we can use our power to look after others and create a better worldâ€”in fact, we have a moral obligation to do so. Our moral agency dictates that if we are given the choice whether to inflict unnecessary suffering, choosing to actively do so means that we can and should be held accountable.

Finally, what we do to animals is far removed from the natural world. We selectively breed, artificially inseminate, mutilate, and abuse them before killing them in horrendous ways in slaughterhouse. This is about as far removed from nature as possible, and does not resemble anything like a food chain [2]. 

Every human atrocity committed has come under the illusion of self-appointed power. The food chain excuse adopts the "might means right" mentality, with the assumption that because we have the physical ability to enslave and exploit others, then we are justified in doing so. But being in the position of power means that we have a responsibility and moral obligation to care for the vulnerable.
