If I’m being honest, I don’t think I’d ever heard the phrasing “but morality is subjective” before I went vegan - and now it’s something I hear quite a lot and yet every time I hear it I always feel slightly astonished. If morality truly was subjective then there would be absolutely no need for a judicial system or prisons, there would be no such thing as good or bad as all behaviour would be completely acceptable. This is really how you can argue against the “morality is subjective” argument, by simply stating that if it was true then murder, rape, arson, theft, etc would by default all be completely moral and acceptable. Ask the person you are talking to, “if you believe morality is subjective, would it therefore be acceptable for someone to murder their partner?”. You could also ask, “using the morality is subjective argument, is it then acceptable for me to beat and kill a dog?”. If you wanted to you could even ask, “if you believe that morality is subjective then would it be justifiable for someone to murder you?”. I think one of the main arguments for why morality is subjective is because animals don’t live under any apparent set moral code, but this is not entirely true, animals do adopt a system of ethical conduct. Many animals display embarrassment, sorrow and regret. These emotions can only be exhibited if the animal understands that their behaviour was wrong in the first place. If no moral code existed then no animal, including humans, would feel regret or guilt, because we would never understand that what we had done was wrong. Unnecessary murder is immoral, we don’t need religion or science to know that. Abusing someone is immoral. Causing intentional pain or suffering to anyone for no necessary reason is immoral. We know these things because within us all exists an understanding of what is right and wrong, we can become blinded by conditioning but all we have to do is put ourselves in the position of the victim to understand why the action of hurting another cannot be morally justified. What morality really comes down to is the awareness of a victim. What is moral should be defined by whether or not what is being done has a victim that is suffering unnecessarily. I believe morality is as simple as “Would I want that done to me? And if not, what right do I have to do it to another?”. H. L Mencken stated: “morality is doing what’s right regardless of what you’re told. Obedience is doing what is told regardless of what is right.”
