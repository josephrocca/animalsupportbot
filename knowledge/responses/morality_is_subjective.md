To state that morality is subjective is to say that morals vary person to person. If that is the case, there would be no need for a judicial system and no behavior could be classified as good or bad since all behaviour would be completely acceptable. Any kind of harm inflicted upon someone or animal could then be seen as permissible, depending on the individualâ€™s moral code.

Many people employ this argument since they believe animals do not live under any apparent moral code, but this is not entirely true since animals are sentient beings with a conscience. Many animals display a multitude of emotions including embarrassment, sorrow, and regret[1]. These emotions can only be exhibited if the animal understands that their behavior was wrong in the first place.

Inflicting unnecessary pain, abuse, and death are considered immoral. We are innately aware of this sense of what is right and wrong, but may be blinded by societal conditioning especially when it comes to (non-domestic) animals. What morality really boils down to is awareness and empathy of a victim. It can be as simple as asking: would I want that done to me? And if not, what right do I have to do it to another?
