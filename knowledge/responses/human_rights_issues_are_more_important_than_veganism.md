Should we fix human problems first? 

If someone was to point to the homelessness crisis, another person could point to other pressing local and global issues—such as reduced benefits for the disabled or exploitation of garment workers—as alternative issues to address and fix. Yes, all of these issues need solving, but nothing is achieved by devaluing any of them. Being vegan is as simple as not eating animal products, not wearing animal skin, not purchasing cosmetics tested on animals, and not supporting animal exploitation of any kind. You can be a humanitarian and a vegan. You can volunteer at a homeless shelter, build schools and hospitals in impoverished countries, and still be a vegan. Being vegan is a passive action, it requires very little from the individual. 

One of the main issues with this excuse is that it really highlights the underlying belief that humans are not animals and we exist as separate or superior to non-human animals. It is a very clear indicator of our society's speciesist mentality [1]. Beyond this point, if we all turned vegan, we wouldn’t just end animal exploitation, we would end some of the most important human rights issues facing our species today. Around 768 million people in the world experience undernourishment. About a third of global cropland is for the feed of animals raised for food. If crops were instead used for direct human consumption, there would be enough food to feed 10 billion people by 2050 within environmental-friendly limits [2]. Choosing to adopt a plant-based diet could help end the unfair distribution of food. 

Furthermore, slaughterhouse workers have high rates of suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, PTSD, depression and anxiety among any other profession [3]. If we all went vegan, we could end the exploitation of tannery workers in India, Bangladesh, and other countries where 90% of workers die before the age of 50 and children are born heavily disabled due to the poisonous chemicals required in the production of leather [4]. If we all went vegan, we could end the displacement and destroyed livelihood of tribal groups in the Amazon, whose communities are being uprooted and destroyed so that the animal agriculture industries can destroy more of the rainforest [5,6]. And we would root out one of the last remaining sources of worker abuse in developed countries.

When faced with such staggering facts, it is obvious that human exploitation is required to produce animal products. As such, any attempt to devalue the suffering of animals with that of humans is not only disingenuous but untrue. If we care about the suffering of humans, then we should be vegan.
