It’s funny how when you tell people that you are a vegan activist, or even just a supporter of animal rights, people all of a sudden become the most ardent humanitarians. The excuse “but shouldn’t we be concentrating on solving human issues” is then conjured up in act of defiant justification for continuing the consumption of animal products. But is this a justifiable excuse, should we fix human problems first? One of the key problems with this excuse is it can be applied to anything. If someone was to say “I think it’s really important that we deal with helping the homeless" you could say, “but shouldn’t we be worrying about fixing Syria?” or, “I think we need to address the slashing of benefits for the disabled” one could say, “but shouldn’t we be more worried about the exploitation of garment workers in Bangladesh?”. All of these issues need solving and nothing is achieved by devaluing any of them. Being vegan is as simple as not eating animal products, not wearing animal skin, not purchasing cosmetics tested on animals and not supporting animal exploitation of any kind. So you can be a humanitarian and a vegan. You can volunteer at a homeless shelter and be vegan and you can be building schools and hospitals in impoverished countries and still be a vegan. Being vegan is a passive action, it requires very little from the individual. One of the main issues with this excuse is that it really highlights the underlying belief that many people have, which is that humans are not animals and we exist as separate or superior to the animal kingdom. It is a very clear indictment of the speciesist mentality our society has. And beyond all of this, what most non-vegans don’t seem to realise is that if we all turned vegan we wouldn’t just end animal exploitation, we would end some of the most important human rights issues facing our species today. We are currently growing enough food to feed around 12 billion people and yet in a world of only 7 and a half billion, around 800 million people are living in a state of starvation due to lack of food - food that we have but that we feed to non-human animals instead so that we can eat their flesh. In fact the United States alone could feed every single one of those 800 million people with the grain that they feed to livestock animals. Furthermore, 82% of starving children live in countries where food is grown to feed livestock animals. Going vegan could end this unfair distribution of food. If we all went vegan we would end the exploitation of migrant workers and people in poverty, who work in slaughterhouses out of necessity and have some of the highest rates of suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, PTSD, depression and anxiety in any profession. If we all went vegan we would end the exploitation of tannery workers in India, Bangladesh and other third world countries where 90% of workers die before the age of 50 and have children born heavily disabled due to all the poisonous chemicals required in the production of leather. If we all went vegan we would end the exploitation of tribal groups in the Amazon, whose communities are being uprooted and destroyed so that the animal agriculture industries can destroy more of the rainforest. Going vegan allows us to become more in touch with our innate compassion, if we all went vegan society would naturally become more loving and gentle. How could we hurt another human being if as a society we felt that inflicting suffering onto a chicken was immoral? When faced with the staggering facts that show just how much human exploitation is required to produce the animal products we eat and wear, it becomes obvious that any attempt to devalue the suffering of animals with that of humans is not only disingenuous but ill-conceived. The excuse “but shouldn’t we be concentrating on human rights issues” is not justifiable because being vegan means we ARE concentrating on human issues. If we care about the suffering of humans then we should be vegan. If confronted with this excuse you could try asking: “Do you think it’s strange that we have enough food to feed 56 billion land animals every year, yet there are 800 million people currently living in a state of starvation?” Or, “How does the fact that there is war in the Middle East or people living homeless make it acceptable for you to pay someone else to kill and butcher an animal?"
