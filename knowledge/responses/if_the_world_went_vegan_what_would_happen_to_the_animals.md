Some believe that the world becoming vegan would result in an excess of animals, who would either wreak havoc or need to be slaughtered in order to be discarded.

Animal agriculture works on a system of supply and demand. Farmers only breed as many animals as they can sell (otherwise, it would not be economically viable for them). Rather than the world becoming vegan overnight, it will instead be a gradual process over a long period. As more and more people go vegan, less animals will be bred in proportion with the rise of veganism. Consequently, we will never end up with a situation where billions of animals are released into the wild or taken to the slaughterhouse to be killed and then discarded. 

Some may argue that these animals may go extinct, but it can be argued that farmed animals are not natural animals since they have been domesticated, selectively bred, and modified for human consumption. Dairy cows have been modified to produce up to ten times more milk than is natural. Broiler chickens have been bred to grow abnormally large within a short timeframe[1]. Egg-laying hens have been bred to produce up to 300 eggs a year rather than the twelve they would produce naturally[2]. In a vegan world, there are several options for consideration such as sustaining healthy populations of these animals, replenishing our ecosystems with more natural biodiversity, or reintroducing animals back into their habitats.

It is worth noting that animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction. As more land is cleared for livestock operations, either for raising farmed animals or producing animal feed, loss of habitat leads to animals being displaced and ultimately going extinct[3]. On a macro-level, livestock production has a significant impact on climate change as a whole due to release of methane and warming of the planet[4], which affects the livability of habits for humans and animals. Scientists and biologists believe that the largest mass species extinction within the past 65 million years is currently underway[5].
