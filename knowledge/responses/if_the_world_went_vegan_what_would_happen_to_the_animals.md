On face value this excuse can seem quite comical but actually I think it’s an excuse that can seem very valid if you don’t know the answer. This excuse is the idea that if we stopped eating animals they would all just be released and cause havoc to our environment, or they’d all be slaughtered and then just discarded. To debunk this excuse all we have to do is highlight the fact that animal agriculture works on a system of supply and demand, when we buy products we demand that more be supplied. Farmers only breed as many animals as they can sell, they’re not going to breed more because it quite simply would not be economically viable. Now because the world isn’t going to go vegan overnight and it will instead be a gradual process over a long period, this means that as more and more people go vegan, less and less animals will be bred in proportion with the rise of veganism. As the movement continues to grow this pattern will also continue which means that when we eventually end up with a vegan world, farmers simply won’t be breeding animals into production anymore. Consequently, we will never end up with a situation where billions of animals are being released into the wild or taken to the slaughterhouse to be killed and then discarded. I’ve even had non-vegans tell me that it isn’t vegan to be vegan because billions of animals would need to be slaughtered, but once we apply the supply and demand logic to this excuse it becomes easy to understand why that statement is entirely disingenuous. The conversation will often then go on to the non-vegan arguing that this will mean these animals will go extinct. This is actually quite an interesting argument as obviously the number of these animals will decline exponentially to the point of extinction. Now there’s a couple of ways of looking at this argument: firstly, the animals that we eat and exploit for food are not natural animals, they have all been domesticated, selectively bred and modified in some way that means they were never meant to exist. Dairy cows have been modified to produce up to ten times more milk than they would naturally. Egg-laying hens have been bred to produce up to 300 eggs a year rather than the 10 - 20 they would produce naturally. Broiler chickens have been bred to grow abnormally large at an incredibly quick rate and sheep have been modified to produce more wool than they would naturally and often give birth to more lambs than they would naturally. Because of these modifications it’s very unlikely that any of these animals would be able to survive on their own in the wild and as such, they would need humans to care for and look after them. Ultimately, we would really end up with a choice of whether or not we wanted to sustain healthy populations of these animals or whether we think it would be more ethical to allow them to no longer exist and instead replenish our eco-systems with their natural bio-diversity. We would also theoretically be able to reintroduce many of the natural wild animals back into their habitats as we would no longer require such huge expansive areas of land for animal agriculture. There would of course still be sanctuaries as well, where rescued animals would be allowed to live their life and there will always be an abundance of people who would be happy to put the time and money into looking after the farmed animals and giving them the care that they need. I think it’s also important to note that many of these animals are not native to the countries which they are artificially bred in to. For example, sheep are not native to America and shouldn’t be there and unfortunately, it’s the natural wildlife who are then the ones who face the consequences of this as their natural habitat is destroyed in order to make way for farming land. Native wild animals are also often hunted and killed in order to protect the farmer’s flocks. I think if someone mentions extinction, it’s important to point out that animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction - and we are in the largest mass species extinction of the past 65 million years. So if they’re concerned about species extinction, they should really go vegan!
