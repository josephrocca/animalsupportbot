I haven’t talked that much about the environmental aspects of veganism and I think it is pretty much unanimously agreed that a vegan diet is significantly better for the environment than a non-vegan diet. In fact, the United Nations stated not so long ago that to avoid the worst effects of climate change, everybody needs to shift to a plant- based diet immediately. However, one environmental argument that many people often cite is that soya farming has environmental consequences such as rainforest destruction and habitat loss. Now undoubtedly the environmental impact and destruction caused by soya is massive, but we need only consider that 85% of the soya that is grown is fed to livestock animals - and that’s a conservative estimate. This pretty much dispatches the argument immediately as we can sustainably produce enough soya for human consumption - the issue surrounding soya farming is that such vast quantities are produced to feed livestock animals, which is why it’s bad for the environment, not because vegans consume soya milk. If someone brings up the soya argument say, “you’re right, soya farming is destructive for the environment, but did you know that over 85% of the soya grown is fed to livestock animals? It’s because of animal agriculture that soya is currently so destructive.”. You could also go on to say, “as you are worried about the environmental impact of soya farming, do you think you will give up animal products now that you know they are the main reason for the destructive elements of soya farming?”. I think another important thing to mention is that the soya that is used in foods for humans isn’t just used in vegan favourites such as tofu. It’s found in cereals, processed foods, breads, sauces, mayonnaise, animal flesh products, chocolate, sweets. Basically soya is predominantly used in non-vegan foods. Furthermore, something a farmer said to me not so long ago was “well you can go and enjoy your gm-soya!”. Interestingly however, if you actually look, many vegan soya products are advertised as using non-gm soya, or at least the ones here in the UK are. The majority of the gm-soya is grown to feed livestock animals, so if someone ever tries to use that as an argument (although I doubt many people will), remember to tell them that. So it’s pretty obvious that if people are really concerned about the environmental destruction caused by soya farming then it would be hypocritical of them if they don’t become vegan. Lets also consider that 1 - 2 acres of rainforest is cleared every second for animal agriculture and that animal agriculture, including livestock and their byproducts are responsible for up to 51% of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to just 13% for the whole transport system combined. Basically there is no such thing as an animal eating environmentalist or a vegetarian environmentalist for that matter. If you care about the environment then you have to be a vegan, it’s that simple. When talking to an environmentalist it’s so important to emphasise this information to them, as most environmentalists still aren’t vegan - but why is this? I think one of the main reasons is because people expect governments and corporations to be the ones leading the change when it comes to the environment and it becomes incredibly easy to point the finger at businesses that exploit the environment and blame them for all the issues we are currently facing, rather than looking at our own actions and assessing whether or not we are doing everything we can as individuals. I think when we talk to non-vegan environmentalists we need to empower them to understand that as individuals we have the power to make all the difference and we can’t expect politicians and CEOs to implement real change. We need to tell them that it’s up to us the consumer to lead the change and even though absolutely our governments need to switch to renewable energy and stop taking handouts from oil and natural gas lobbyists, it’s hypocritical of us to demand change if we aren’t willing to make simple changes ourselves.
