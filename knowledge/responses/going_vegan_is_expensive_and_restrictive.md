Vegan diets have become somewhat synonymous with the idea of restrictive eating, people view vegan food as limiting and there is also a misconception that vegan diets are expensive and elitist. Let’s start with the idea that veganism is a restrictive diet. Since becoming vegan I eat a much larger and more varied range of foods than I ever did before and I’m cooking with ingredients I’d never heard of. Becoming vegan encouraged me to broaden what I eat and if anything I now view being non-vegan as restrictive. You can also point out to the person you are talking to that you still eat the same meals that you used to. You still have pizza, spaghetti bolognese, mac and cheese, curries, nachos, burritos, etc in fact you can veganise pretty much any non-vegan meal. So there’s no way that veganism can be restrictive because you can still eat the same foods that you used to, the only difference being they are now made from plants. So a vegan diet is anything but limiting and for that matter it is anything but extreme. This word extreme is often used to describe vegans but the irony is for the first time my lifestyle is the opposite of extreme. No longer do I eat death, no longer does my food come from animals that screamed in pain as they were murdered. No longer am I eating foods that are the product of enslavement and torture. Those things sound extreme. Not fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, legumes, nuts, potatoes, etc - foods that grow naturally and that don’t scream in agony. How can a vegan diet be extreme, when it consists of eating foods that prevent and cure disease, foods that increase the longevity of our lives, foods that give us more energy and help us to live more harmoniously with animals? Non-vegans eat products that give them an abundance of illnesses and diseases such as cancer and heart disease, their foods come from buildings called slaughterhouses and are produced from animals that were mutilated and enslaved. Now that sounds extreme. So, how about “but vegan food is expensive and elitist”. If you go into any supermarket, the most expensive foods tend to be the flesh and cheese and the cheapest foods are the beans, rice, potatoes, pasta, lentils, etc. Since going vegan I actually spend less money on food than I used to, as the majority of my diet consists of ingredients like oats, starches, carbohydrates and vegetables, all of which are among the cheapest foods you can buy. The only time where vegan food can be more expensive is when buying the substitutes, for example, frozen vegan ‘chicken’ nuggets are still more expensive than non-vegan chicken nuggets, but this is to do with supply and demand. As more people go vegan and buy those products, the cheaper they will become. You can now get soya milk for the same price as cow’s milk and the vegan cheeses in supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and Tesco are the same price if not cheaper than the cheese made from cow’s milk. You can also get vegan burgers and vegan mince for pretty much the same price, so even the substitutes are becoming more accessible and affordable all of the time. A vegan diet doesn’t mean you have to be eating expensive organic fruits or going to juice bars, the foundation of a good vegan diet is affordable and accessible foods, which are much cheaper than animal products. Plus when I used to handle flesh, I would hate it, it was slimy, smelly and I’d have to wash my hands and surfaces afterwards. Now when I handle fruits and vegetables I love it, they’re so colourful and vibrant, all you do is give them a rinse and they’re good to go, I don’t have to scrub my hands clean once I’ve chopped them. Now that I’m vegan I look forward to cooking, I used to view it as a chore but now it’s one of my favourite parts of the day. This brings us to the final point, as vegans we always get asked by non-vegans why we eat animal product substitutes if we don’t want to eat animal products. As much as I hate the thought of eating animal products now and it makes me feel sick and very uncomfortable, I, like most vegans, didn’t become vegan because I disliked the taste of animal products. Before I became vegan I loved KFC and cow flesh burgers, I loved halloumi and Domino’s pizzas - but I realised that there are more important things in life than my sensory pleasure. As a species we have to understand that justifying our actions by the fact that we find enjoyment in them is not acceptable if it negatively impacts the lives of others. Vegans eat animal product substitutes because we enjoy the texture and the flavour - and it’s even better because no animal had to die or be exploited for our enjoyment of them.
