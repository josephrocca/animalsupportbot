This excuse is similar to the food chain argument in the sense that it operates under the belief that our consumption of animals is morally justified because it is part of some natural order and as such, we are merely fulfilling our responsibility as a species within the animal kingdom. Claiming that eating animals is the circle of life is a contradiction because animal agriculture is the circle of continuous unnecessary torture and death. Life is the exact opposite of what the animal agriculture industry is. The only two moments of life that are certain are our birth and our death and this is really all the circle of life actually refers to, everything that is born must indeed come full circle and die as well. What happens between these two events is variable and has nothing to do with a preordained circle of life. The concept of the circle of life is used by non-vegans who are trying to assert that humans are entitled to kill animals because of a pre-ordained natural order that is out of our control. They are essentially arguing that just because everything that lives must die, it therefore means we are morally justified to intentionally take life. This would theoretically mean then that we are justified to take any life that we want, in any manner that we choose because after all, it is the circle of life. I could needlessly murder a dog, I could needlessly murder a cat, or indeed, I could needlessly murder any animal for that matter. Using the logic behind the circle of life argument you would be morally excused for murdering a human as well. If someone you are talking to brings up the circle of life argument ask them, “by the logic that we are morally justified to slaughter animals because all life dies anyway, would it therefore be acceptable for me to cut the throat of a dog?”. It’s also interesting how the circle of life argument only applies to us killing non-human animals, it doesn’t also transpose to when humans kill other humans, or indeed to when non-human animals kill humans. When we hear about a shark or a crocodile killing a human we don’t sit back and say, “oh well, it’s the circle of life, what is born must one day die!”. No, we get angry and we send hunters or fishermen to try and kill the animal in an act of vengeance and because we fear that animal may go on to kill more people. If a human murders another human, we arrest them, punish them and send them to jail. However, if we are to subscribe to the logic of this excuse then murder would not be a crime or a punishable offence because death is inevitable and for that very reason it is acceptable to take the life of anyone we wish. If the needless murder of animals is justifiable because of the circle of life, then that means the needless murder of any animal is justifiable, not just the ones we conveniently want this logic to apply to. Furthermore, if the basis of the argument is grounded in what is perceived to be natural then that still provides no justification for how we raise, farm, exploit and kill animals as the systems that we have created couldn’t be further detached from nature. How can forcibly impregnating cows so that we can drink the milk that was designed to feed their children, be natural? It defies nature. How can raising animals in cages and then gassing them or anally electrocuting them so we can wear their skin be considered natural? How can putting cosmetics and toiletries into the eyes of animals and burning their skin with corrosive substances be morally justified through the idea of the circle of life? All of these things defy any notion of the circle of life, because the circle of life claims that what we are doing is intrinsically linked to nature but in reality, what we do couldn’t be further removed from the natural world. If we add to this the fact that 15 of our top 16 killers are caused by eating animal products it becomes apparent that it’s not only the circle of death for animals, but for us as well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gEiweaAVQ).
