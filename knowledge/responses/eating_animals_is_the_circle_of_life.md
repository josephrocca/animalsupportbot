What exactly do you mean by "the circle of life"? If you mean that all things that live will eventually die - yes, this is certainly true. However, it's not clear how the inevitability of death justifies the continuous unecessary torture and death of animals in the agriculture industry.

Using the fact that all things die eventually is a terrible justification for unecessarily killing living beings - this could be extended to needlessly murdering a dog, cat, or a human even. How much empathy would someone receive for murdering a bunch of dogs, and justifying that with "oh all things die eventually, it's the circle of life"?

And the consumption of animals and their products is just that: **unecesssary**. The American Dietetic Association, the largest body of nutrition and diet professionals in the US, has stated that a plant-based (vegan) diet is nutritionally adequate and safe for all stages of life, including pregnancy [1].

If you don't need to consume animal products to survive (which is the case for the vast majority of people), directly paying for and participating in the unnecessary death of animals is unjustifiable - especially if your excuse is "the circle of life".
