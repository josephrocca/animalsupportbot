Bee's make honey for bee's, and not for humans.

Honey is a source of food for bee's. A honey bee collects as much nectar as its 'honey stomach' can hold before returning to its hive. The honey bee's 'honey stomach' contains enzymes that break down nectar into honey. To complete the honey-making process, the honey bee regurgitates the nectar from its 'honey stomach' into the mouth of a 'house bee'. The 'house bee' may repeat this process of regurgitation with other 'house bees' until it reaches the honeycomb for storage. The stored honey is a source of nutrition for bees during times of poor weather and during the winter. According to [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/why-go-vegan/honey-industry), a honey bee produces 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime. That is approximately 0.6 grams of honey for a lifetime of work.

Honey is derived from the exploitation of bees. Honey farming practices are unethical, cruel, and bad for the environment. I've been asked why honey farming is wrong, if bees are good for the environment? Isn't it beneficial to have more bees? To be clear, the main purpose of commercial honey farming is the yield of honey and nothing else. For comparison, ["Bumblebees are much more efficient pollinators than honeybees. They mainly forage for pollen rather than nectar, and transfer more pollen to the pistils with each visit."](https://www.buglogical.com/bumble-bees-natural-pollination/#:~:text=Bumblebees%20are%20much%20more%20efficient,the%20pistils%20with%20each%20visit.&text=Bumblebees%20visit%20many%20more%20blooms%20per%20minute%20than%20honeybees.) The mass breeding of farmed bees affects the population of other bees by increasing the competition for food with native species of bees, like the bumblebee. When honey is removed from a hive, beekeepers either leave enough to sustain the colony or replace what they removed with a sugar substitute that can be harmful to the bee's health. If a colony becomes too aggressive or infected, they are most commonly euthanized with a soapy-water mixture and drowned. A bee-keeper records the entire process [here.](https://youtu.be/O4ldpyIE5t4)   

The main point here is why bother with honey when so many delicious plant-based syrups and sweeteners exist. Agave nectar, coconut nectar, and maple syrup are just a few of the many honey alternatives out there. [Click here](https://www.yourdailyvegan.com/2016/09/vegan-honey-alternatives/) for other honey alternatives. Not only are these plant-based alternatives delicious, but they are not derived from the exploitation of animals.
