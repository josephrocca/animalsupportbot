Bees make honey for bees; and not for humans. Honey is a source of food for bees. A honey bee collects as much nectar as its 'honey stomach' can hold before returning to its hive. The honey bee's 'honey stomach' contains enzymes that break down the nectar into honey. To complete the honey-making process, the honey bee regurgitates the nectar from its 'honey stomach' into the mouth of a 'house bee'. The 'house bees' may repeat this process of regurgitation with other 'house bees' until it reaches the honeycomb for storage. The stored honey is a source of nutrition for bees during times of poor weather and during the winter. According to [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/why-go-vegan/honey-industry), a honey bee produces 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime. That is approximately 0.6 grams of honey for a lifetime of work.

Bees are intelligent creatures. Bees live in large social communities, they are efficient workers, they can communicate with one another, and they can learn from each other. They perform different jobs based on the needs of the hive. Some bees forage while others guard. They can communicate through odor signals and use dance to point others to sources of food. Young bees learn from older bees by watching them work. A recent study states that honeybees can learn to use colors as symbolic representations for addition and subtraction. You can read more about the study [here.](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/2/eaav0961) Bee's are insects, but that does not mean they are not intelligent. Bees undergo some of the same treatments that other farmed animals do. They are bred, exploited, manipulated, and slaughtered. 

Honey farming practices are bad for the environment. How is honey farming wrong if bees are good for the environment? Haven't you watched bee movie? Isn't it beneficial to have more bees? To be clear, the main purpose of commercial honey farming is the yield of honey and nothing else. For comparison, ["Bumblebees are much more efficient pollinators than honeybees. They mainly forage for pollen rather than nectar, and transfer more pollen to the pistils with each visit."](https://www.buglogical.com/bumble-bees-natural-pollination/#:~:text=Bumblebees%20are%20much%20more%20efficient,the%20pistils%20with%20each%20visit.&text=Bumblebees%20visit%20many%20more%20blooms%20per%20minute%20than%20honeybees.) The mass breeding of farmed bees affects the population of other bees by increasing the competition for food with native species of bees, like the bumblebee.

Honey farming practices are cruel. Cruel practices include wing clipping, artificial insemination, and mass euthanization. A queen bee will have her wings clipped to prevent the hive from swarming. Queens are kept in a small cage for weeks or months to control breeding. Artificially inseminating a queen bee involves ripping the heads off of male bees to stimulate arousal. The lower half of the decapitated bodies are crushed to collect the sperm. Then the queen is injected with the sperm of several decapitated bees. Read more about cruel and unethical practices [here.](http://thinkdifferentlyaboutsheep.weebly.com/factory-farming-bees.html) If a colony becomes too aggressive or infected, they are most commonly euthanized with a soapy-water mixture and drowned. A bee-keeper records the euthanization process [here.](https://youtu.be/O4ldpyIE5t4)

Honey farming practices are unethical. Honey is derived from the exploitation of bees. When honey is removed from a hive, beekeepers leave enough to sustain the colony or substitute what was removed with sugar water. Sugar water is harmful to the health of bees since it does not contain the same nutrients as honey.

Why bother with honey when so many delicious plant-based syrups and sweeteners exist. Agave nectar, coconut nectar, and maple syrup are just a few of the many honey alternatives out there. [Click here](https://www.yourdailyvegan.com/2016/09/vegan-honey-alternatives/) for other honey alternatives. Not only are these plant-based alternatives delicious, but these alternatives are cruelty-free.
