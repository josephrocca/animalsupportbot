It is true we have been eating animals for many centuries, but does the longevity of something justify its continuation and existence? Is the excuse, “eating animals is a tradition” a valid justification for not becoming vegan? 

Let’s just consider that slavery was once considered a tradition [1], as is/was treating a woman as less than a man [2,3,4] - but does the fact that these things were once traditional justify them? I think (and hope) most of us would say no. 

If humanity had gone through history too stubborn and ignorant to change because of so called tradition then we would never have evolved or adapted. Another example is female genital mutilation (FGM). It’s been performed on women for centuries and is still performed today [5]. Clearly, using tradition as an argument in support of FGM and violating the rights of young women is absurd.

You see, the logic here is extremely flawed, as both acts are absolutely horrific and the excuse of tradition serves in no way as any kind of justification for them. To apply this argument to another scenario where non-human animals are the ones affected, bullfighting is very much considered a tradition [6] as is the slaughter of dolphins in Taiji [7], but does that mean that these things should still continue? The Yulin Dog Meat Festival [8] and the Boknal Dog Meat Festival [9] are both annual events where thousands of dogs and cats are killed and eaten, they are both traditional events and yet throughout the western world we voice our disgust at these festivals. 

Tradition has never and will never be a valid excuse for the acts we have committed as a species and especially not for the continued murder, abuse, and consumption of sentient life.
