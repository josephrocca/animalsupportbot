The notion that intelligence defines worth of life can often become one of the main justifications as to why humans raise and kill animals. This premise does not hold up to logic for a number of reasons, with the first being that many of these farmed animals possess intelligence and rich inner lives derived from their cognitive and emotional capabilities.

Pigs perform similarly to dogs in a number of tasks (even outperforming them in certain instances) and possess the same cognitive abilities as a three-year-old human[1]. Chickens are able to perceive objects and time, and day-old chicks can perform basic arithmetic[2]. Contrary to popular belief, these animals display a range of complex cognitive, emotional, communicative, and social behavior.

Why would someone who is more intelligent be more deserving of life? When applied to human beings, would you view one personâ€™s life as having higher value than someone who has cognitive impairments or learning difficulties? 

Even if this line of thinking had any rationale, if we eat specific foods according to their intelligence then we should be eating the least intelligent species: plants. Objectively speaking, without a central nervous system, plants lack the cognitive abilities possessed by animals. If we truly believe in the excuse that intelligence defines the worth of life, then we should all be vegan anyway.
