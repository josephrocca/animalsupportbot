As a species we pride ourselves on our intelligence and we have achieved some truly incredible things, but unfortunately the idea that intelligence defines worth of life can often become one of the main driving forces as to why we justify raising and killing animals. Straight away this idea creates a whole host of problems, for starters pigs have been shown to be more intelligent than dogs and in fact have the same cognitive abilities as a three year old human, so surely we should be eating dogs, not pigs? Moreover, the animals that we eat, the cows, sheep, chickens, etc are vastly more conventionally intelligent than many other animals that exist with us on this planet, so if we did eat animals according to their intelligence we would instead be living off of insects. But if you think about it, if we eat specific foods according to their intelligence then we should be eating the least intelligent species, which are actually plants. Plants are the least intelligent species that exist as they lack the cognitive abilities that animals have, meaning that if we truly believe in the intelligence defines worth of life excuse then we should all be vegan anyway. I used the phrase “conventionally intelligent” earlier because one of the other issues with this excuse is that intelligence is largely subjective, as Einstein famously said, “If you judge a fish on their ability to climb a tree they will spend their whole life believing that they are stupid.”. But when you think about it, what exactly does intelligence have to do with worth of life? Why would someone who is more intelligent be more deserving of life? It doesn’t make any sense. As a species most of us are very quick to take credit for work that others have done, people say “but other animals have never built spaceships and been to space” - to which I ask “have you ever built a spaceship and been to space?”. Or people say “but we have written symphonies” - to which I ask “have you ever written a symphony?”. When someone brings up the intelligence argument, ask them: “Does intelligence define worth of life?” “Is your life worth more than someone who has learning difficulties?” “If intelligence equals dominance does that mean that anyone with a high IQ can do what they want to someone with a lower IQ?” “A pig has been shown to be more intelligent than a dog, does this fact mean that you will stop eating pigs and start eating dogs instead?” I think it also has to be said that for all of our intelligence and technological advancements, we arguably do the least intelligent things of any species. We are the only species that is destroying our planet, the only home that we have. We mindlessly consume without looking at the impact our actions are having. We are destroying the rainforests and the ocean at a frightening rate and we are polluting so much that our world is literally being destroyed in front of us and yet so little is being done to safeguard the future of even our own species. If you look at our actions, they certainly do not represent the actions of an intelligent species.
