A plant lacks a central nervous system, pain receptors, and a brain which means that anatomically they do not have the ability to feel pain [1]. Therefore, when we pull plants up from the ground, they cannot process any pain associated with our act of harvesting them. Reasonable people understand that slicing the neck of a cow is in no way comparable to cutting the stems off a broccoli. Likewise, castrating a pig is not similar to peeling a potato.

Looking at animal agriculture data, it takes an estimated seven kilograms of plant feed to create one kilogram of meat [2]. The result is that more plants are killed in the production of animal products than they are in the production of vegan products [3]. Additionally, up to 91% of Amazon rainforest destruction is due to animal agriculture [4], meaning that millions of trees have been and continue to be destroyed because of our consumption of animal products.

If someone honestly believes that plants feel pain, then (by their logic) the consumption of animals is not only causing the suffering of animals, but also causing the alleged suffering of a great number of plants.
