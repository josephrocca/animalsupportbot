A vegan diet is significantly better for the environment than a non-vegan diet. In fact, the United Nations experts endorse the global adoption of a plant-based diet to ameliorate the effects of climate change[1]. 

However, one environmental argument that many people often cite is that soy farming has environmental consequences such as rainforest destruction, as well as loss of habitat and native vegetation in the Amazon and other areas of South America. While the environmental impact and destruction caused by soy is massive, we need only consider that between 77-87% of the soy that is grown is fed to livestock[2,3] (figure varying depending on the source). 

In comparison, only 7% of this soy is used directly for human food products such as tofu, soy milk, edamame beans, and tempeh[3].

It is clear from the figures that the increased demand for processed soy is primarily for animal feed. This rise has been particularly steep since 1990. By 2013, it has increased from 88 million to 227 million tons. This is aligned with the fact that global meat production has more than tripled over the last 50 years, with the largest increase in poultry which is the largest consumer of soy feed[3].

If you care about the environment, then being vegan is the most effective and logical course of action.
