When discussing veganism, one of the strangest yet most commonly used moral justifications for killing animals is that our ancestors used to do it. We often hear people say “you wouldn’t be here if your ancestors didn’t eat meat”, which is not necessarily incorrect but why are we basing our morality on the actions of our ancestors, primitive beings that had no perception of modern day morality and did entirely unethical things such murder and rape without consequence? Surely if eating is animals is acceptable because cavemen did it, then raping and murdering one another today must also be morally justifiable? Ask the non-vegan you are talking to, “do you think it is wise to base our morality on the actions of our primitive ancestors?” or, “if it’s morally justifiable to eat animals because our ancestors used to do it, does that not mean that it must also be morally justifiable to murder each other, as our ancestors use to do that as well?”. If non-vegans really want to live like their ancestors then they would eat a predominantly vegan diet with the exception of some occasional insects. They would also sleep outside, not use technology, speak in primitive and underdeveloped languages, get overly excited by the creation of fire and have incestuous experiences. Another thing people will say similar to the ancestors argument is that “we’ve always eaten meat”. It is such a regressive idea to look into the past for how we should live and basing our actions purely on whether or not we’ve done something for a long period of time is certainly not a good idea, if we did that we would still have slavery and apartheid. If anyone ever brings up the argument “we’ve always done it” ask them, “there was a time when treating a woman as less than a man was all we’d ever done, would that make treating a woman as less than a man morally acceptable today?”. Tied in closely with the ancestors argument is the idea that eating meat helped us evolve into the beings that we are today and because of that it is morally justifiable to continue eating animals. It is common knowledge and widely accepted that we evolved from primates who survived on a diet comprised predominantly of fruits, nuts, leaves and the occasional insects, but our diets have changed and evolved as the environments we’ve lived in have changed and evolved. It is often cited that the reason we are so intelligent now is because we ate meat and many non-vegans claim that it helped us develop and evolve. Even if this is true, it has no relevance to our society today as our brains are not developing every time we eat a big mac, nor are we evolving as a species every time we enter Nando’s. Quite the opposite in fact. As explained in the section of this e-book on nutrition, eating animal products is a hinderance to our health, as opposed to being beneficial. Consuming foods that have a negative impact on our health can therefore not be considered helpful to the evolution of our species. Because of eating animal products, we are dying younger than we would be without them. Couple that with the fact that animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation system combined and is the leading cause of rainforest destruction, oceanic dead zones, species extinction, top soil erosion, land desertification and a whole host of other environmental concerns, it quickly becomes apparent that the future of our evolution depends on us not eating animals. The United Nations has in fact stated that the world needs to shift to a plant- based diet in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change. (http:// www.cowspiracy.com/facts/ - for all environmental facts) Furthermore, there are also other theories as to why our brains developed. The first is that we began to eat cooked starchy foods and more carbohydrate dense foods. These starches would have been readily available and with the brain using 60% of the human body’s blood glucose, such high glucose demands would not have been met on a low carbohydrate diet. Another idea is that we expanded our consciousness by consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms which allowed us to access parts of our brain previously unexplored, which therefore ultimately made us more self-aware and intelligent. Now undoubtedly eating animals helped us survive through times of food scarcity but just as the very foundations of much our society was built upon slavery doesn’t justify slavery in today’s world, the fact that eating animals helped us get to this point or helped us survive in the past, doesn’t justify eating animals in today’s world. In contemporary society we don’t need to eat animals or their secretions and in doing so we are shortening our lifespan, destroying our planet and causing an unimaginable amount of unnecessary harm to innocent, living beings.
