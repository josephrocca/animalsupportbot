The moral justification for killing animals because our ancestors used to do it is not only incorrect, but regressive. Why are we basing our morality on the actions of our ancestors—primitive beings that had no perception of modern-day morality and ethics?

If non-vegans really want to live like their ancestors, then they would eat a predominantly plant-based diet[1]. By this logic, they would also sleep outside, not use technology, and speak in primitive and underdeveloped languages. Looking toward the past for how we should live is problematic, as it would uphold slavery and perpetuate ideas of inferiority based on race, gender, religious, and sexual orientation.

Tied in closely with the above argument is the idea that eating meat helped us evolve. It is common knowledge and widely accepted that we evolved from primates who survived on a diet composed predominantly of fruits, nuts, leaves and the occasional insects[2,3]. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that for human ancestors to efficiently grow a bigger brain, they needed energy-dense foods with glucose. This would be found in starchy foods and more carbohydrate-dense foods, and not in meat which is a poor source of glucose[4].

Eating animals helped us survive through times of food scarcity, but just as the very foundations of much of society was built upon slavery, such actions in the past do not warrant moral applications in today’s world. In contemporary society, with the accessibility of plant-based foods, we do not need to eat animals, which not only is destructive to our health but is also destroying our planet and causing an unimaginable amount of unnecessary suffering to innocent, living beings.
