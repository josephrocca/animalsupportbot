There are several reasons why the idea of "being vegetarian is enough" falls apart under closer inspection of how we as a species obtain non-meat animal products.

### Argument: "The animals aren't dying"

The idea that animals don't in theory have to die for things like milk and eggs may support the idea that vegetarianism is enough from a cruelty point of view. However, this is simply untrue. 

**For chickens and eggs**, what happens to all the male chicks which can't lay eggs? From the moment the eggs hatch, the males are identified and killed. The most common method used to kill male chicks is through the use of industrial grinders, also known as maceration [1]. [This](https://youtu.be/4yaOVvzkyA8list=PLtc3iQTP5EZ8aCW1DoNj36M6dxgc2QWGk) is what happens every day to billions of male chicks, and is considered by the RSPCA UK [2] and American Vetinary Medical Association [3] to be an acceptable and common form of "disposing" of male chicks.

(In 2016, the United Egg Producers pledged to stop chick culling by 2020 [source], but as of 2021, this practice is still continuing with over 300 million chicks still being culled every day in the US alone [4])

This is not even considering the egg laying hens themselves, which are spared from culling, but on average live in such deplorable conditions as to wonder whether being culled is a preferable fate. The majority (75%) of US hens have less living space than a standard piece of printer paper, and as a result of these horrible conditions are mutilated by having their beaks cut off to prevent self-mutilation and even cannibalism [5, 6].

**For cows and dairy**, dairy cows have to be regularaly and forcibly impregnated every year in order to produce milk [7], which in the vast majority of cases ends with slaughter for both her and her offspring.

The biggest tell of the toll that the dairy industry takes on dairy cows' bodies is the fact that the natural lifespan of a cow can be up to 20 years [8], but the stress of the living conditions and cycle of regular insemination and pregnancy leads to a typical lifespan of 4-5 years [9], after which they are slaughtered. As of 2018, 21% of total beef supply in the US comes from dairy cows [10], a clear and direct link between the dairy and meat industry.

On top of these issues with cruelty and suffering, an additional concern with dairy is the environmental impact that it has, with the emissions from 13 dairy firms matching that of the whole of the United Kingdom [11].
