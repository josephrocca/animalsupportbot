When I was a vegetarian I was actually guilty of thinking this for a time before I turned vegan, I thought I had cut out supporting the murder of animals from my diet and that I didn’t need to go to vegan. The problem with this excuse is that even though most vegetarians cut out animal flesh for ethical reasons they are still hugely unaware of the atrocities committed to animals and don’t know the full extent of the ways that we exploit animals, I know that I certainly wasn’t aware. I became a vegetarian believing that animals shouldn’t die for food but I came to this conclusion without researching anything into the slaughter or treatment of animals. I hadn’t watched any slaughterhouse footage and I didn’t feel the need to because in my eyes I was no longer contributing to those systems of violence. I, like many others, was under the illusion that free-range eggs were ethical and that the treatment of dairy cows was humane. I never considered that female cows needed to give birth to produce milk, which really shows the power of the dairy industry and the propaganda that they feed to us. I remember even thinking that it isn’t necessary to become a vegan. I was very wrong. By being a vegetarian we still contribute to the needless torture, abuse and slaughter of animals. Being vegetarian quite simply isn’t enough, especially if the person believes that they are an ethical person. In the egg industry male chicks are a useless byproduct and they serve no use to the industry. So as soon as they are hatched they are thrown by the thousands into industrial grinders where they are minced apart, or they are gassed alive. These are new born babies and their first and only experience of life is being killed. Think of the confusion and fear these chicks feel as they are callously mistreated, thrown onto a conveyor belt and dropped into a grinder or into a machine designed to gas them to death. It’s so important to emphasise that all male chicks are killed regardless of what system of egg production it is. This happens in caged, free-range and organic facilities. Tell people that if they eat eggs they are by default paying for the murder of baby chicks. You can do this by saying something like, “what do you think happens to the male chicks in the egg industry, bear in mind that they are of a different breed to chickens raised for meat and are not suitable to be reared for their flesh?”. Furthermore, if people bring up free-range eggs, ask them “do you know what a free range egg farm looks like?”. You could even go so far as to ask, “do you not think free range could be a marketing ploy to make you buy a product with an eased conscience?”. Remember, free-range eggs still come at the use and abuse of hens. They still often have their beaks trimmed and even though legally they have to have access to the outdoors, many never leave the barn and are unable to access sunlight or fresh air in their entire lives. Even in free-range barns, hens only have on average the space of an iPad each and are crammed together, forced to stand on top of one another. In fact, farmers can legally house 16,000 birds per barn in the UK, which means they can legally house 9 birds per square metre of space. Many hens can’t cope with the stress of being genetically modified to produce 300 eggs per year instead of the 10 - 20 they would naturally, leading to them becoming malnourished and sick with diseases such as osteoporosis. In fact it is reported that more than 45% of egg laying hens break a bone at some point during their lives (http://www.landofhopeandglory.org/facts). Cannibalism is also a big problem on egg farms, with ill and dead birds being pecked at by their fellow birds. After the hens are spent, normally after 72 weeks, they are thrown into crates and are driven to a slaughterhouse, where they are then hung upside down and their throats are slit. Some hens survive this ordeal and are submerged in boiling hot water still alive and are boiled to death. The dairy industry is equally disgusting, like male chicks, newborn male calves are useless to dairy farmers and so they are taken away from their mothers normally within 24 - 72 hours of birth, some are even shot, killed and discarded immediately. The ones that are not shot will either be raised for veal, or they’ll be sold into the beef industry and raised for their flesh. The male calves that are slaughtered for veal are hung upside down and have their throats slit when they are still babies, the veal industry would not exist if it wasn’t for the dairy industry. Furthermore, like humans, cows only produce milk when they have given birth so female cows are forcibly impregnated using a process called artificial insemination in order to make them pregnant. If the calf is female she will also be taken from her mother only a few hours after being born. When people mention dairy I always like to ask, “why do you think a cow produces milk?” - as so many people I speak to simply don’t know why. You can also ask people, “what do you think happens to the calves if we’re drinking the milk that’s made for them?”. Or, “what do you think happens to the male calves in the dairy industry as they don’t produce any milk?”. Dairy cows have also been selectively bred to produce up to 10 times more milk than they would naturally. This overuse of their udders leads to painful infections such as mastitis, which can also cause pus and blood to be filtered into the milk that humans then drink. When they become too weak, or are unable to bear anymore children or produce anymore milk, they are taken to the slaughterhouse, where their throats are slit and they are left to bleed to death so that their flesh can be used for cheap meat products. Trapped in a hellish cycle of forced impregnation and forced lactation, repeatedly abused and exploited by the farmers, dairy cows, who in nature can live up to 25 years, die normally after only 4 to 5. For me this is one of the easiest ways to convince an ethical vegetarian, just explain to them that all the animals in the egg and dairy industries end up in the slaughterhouse. You should also explain the suffering animals endure in the clothing, entertainment and cosmetic industries, as vegetarians often support these systems too (I was a vegetarian that wore leather and went to the zoo). With dairy I always like to ask things along the lines of, “don’t you think it’s strange that we drink the milk from another species of animal, whose milk is actually meant for their babies and not for us?”. Or, “would you ever suckle on the udders of a cow yourself?”. Or, “would you ever drink pig milk, or rat milk?”. Now obviously being vegetarian still contributes massively to the suffering of animals, but many vegetarians are simply not aware of this, so any conversation with a vegetarian is a great opportunity for spreading veganism.
