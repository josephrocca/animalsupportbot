People who can go vegan, should, but who exactly does this include? First, let’s talk about who this typically doesn’t include.

It is important to recognize that for financial or other personal reasons, not everyone has the freedom to go vegan. For example, if someone is without housing or is in a poor socio-economic condition, it is completely understandable that their focus is on supporting themselves. This is not to say that individuals in these conditions cannot go vegan if they so desire, but these individuals are not the focus of vegan activism. In order to fight for the liberation of animals, we must first be able to keep ourselves supported, and individuals who need to consume animals products out of necessity are not to be blamed for doing so.

As well, for many indigenous communities, hunting or fishing is an important cultural commitment. Although vegans would argue that killing an animal is never truly ethical, it is very important to recognize the difference between traditional practices and factory farming. Seeing as the main goal of veganism is to end the exploitation of animals as much as possible, factory farming and widespread use of animal products is the main target of vegan activism, as opposed to small scale community hunting and fishing. Those who consume animal products as a part of their cultural activities are not the primary focus of vegans.

There is also the topic of illness as a barrier to veganism. Although there are no medical conditions known to make veganism impossible, certain illnesses or differences in ability may make veganism difficult for some individuals. For those who have medical conditions where this is applicable, they are not the focus of vegan activists. It is important to note that you should always check with a medical professional regarding nutritional concerns as they can give you specific guidance for your needs.

Now that we have covered some of the most common groups that are not the focus of vegans, let’s talk about who should go vegan. If you do not fall into those prior categories and are buying animal products, you should go vegan. If you have the power to choose between a veggie burger and a beef burger, why not choose the ethical option? If you have the means to educate yourself on animal welfare issues, and the power to change your contributions to these issues, you should go vegan. From animal welfare to human welfare, the environment and your health, there are many advantages to going vegan. In many regards, a vegan diet can be less expensive and healthier than an omnivorous diet. Foods such as legumes and rice are very inexpensive and easy to access and prepare. Especially with the expansive list of mock animal products, you do not even need to worry about missing out on your favourite meals. There is such a variety of vegan options to choose from, you just need to do the research. Although there are barriers to veganism, the more individuals that go vegan, the easier it will become for those who currently cannot do so.
