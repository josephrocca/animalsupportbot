**Being vegan is not about being perfect, it's about doing the best you can for the wellbeing of non-human animals. And everyone can do that!** A common misconception is that being vegan is being perfect and looking for the minutest trace of animal product in everything and choosing not to consume it if it is not vegan. The truth is, being vegan is a learning process and it's about doing your best. The difference between a vegan consuming animal products and a non-vegan consuming animal products is that the vegan would learn about the impacts of their actions and try their best to not repeat that experience again. Making a mistake doesn't make you not a vegan, choosing to not try is what makes you not vegan.

**Just because it is more difficult for others to eliminate animal products from their lives does not mean we don't have to.** The solution is not to throw up our hands and say veganism must be wrong, we must continue to exploit animals because parts of the population simply do not have resources to stop. The solution is for those of us who can to go vegan and advocate for the cause so that there is an increase in accessibility for veganism.
