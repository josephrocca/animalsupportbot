**Being vegan is not about being perfect, it's about doing the best you can for the wellbeing of non-human animals. And everyone can do that!** A common misconception is that being vegan is being perfect and looking for the minutest trace of animal product in everything and choosing not to consume it if it is not vegan. The truth is, being vegan is a learning process and it's about doing your best. The difference between a vegan consuming animal products and a non-vegan consuming animal products is that the vegan would learn about the impacts of their actions and try their best to not repeat that experience again. Making a mistake doesn't make you not a vegan, choosing not to try is what makes you not vegan.

**Those more able to eliminate animal products from their lives have a greater obligation to do so.** Just because someone else has fewer resources to go vegan doesn't excuse your consumption of animal products when you are able to choose the vegan alternative. The animals have no choice at all and their only hope is our compassion. By choosing to go vegan, we vote with our wallets with every purchase and drive change and make veganism more accessible. All of us who are enjoying vegan ice cream and beyond burgers in fast food chains now owe that progress to vegans who came before us, who chose to go vegan before any of these were available. If the ones with choices and ability to go vegan do not do so, we would have no way of saving the animals.

**Vegan foods are more accessible than animal products.** Vegan food is inherently cheaper than animal products. It cost much less land and water to provide food for a human on a vegan diet than to provide food to upwards of 8000 animals (not including fishes and seafood) and then feeding those animals to one human over their lifetime. That's why [meat consumption is correlated with GDP per capita](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-consumption-vs-gdp-per-capita?time=1990..2017). That also means that the nations with highest amounts of animal product consumptions are also the wealthiest nations and the ones with most resources available to go vegan.
