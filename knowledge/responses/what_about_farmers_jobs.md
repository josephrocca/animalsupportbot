So this is actually a slightly tricky argument, as it’s an important issue and one I imagine will be used more frequently as the vegan movement progresses. When someone brings up the issue of farmer’s livelihoods I normally say something like, “you’re absolutely right, we do need to consider the livelihoods of farmers, who are often born into the farming community and have never known anything different in their lives and have never questioned the morality of what they do.”. The reason I do this is because it makes us seem reasonable. Most people see farming as an idyllic, traditional job and we’re fed an idea of good, honest farmers struggling to make enough money to survive. Now this may not be strictly true, but it is what people believe and I think the most effective way of dealing with this is to acknowledge that farmer’s livelihoods are at risk and are therefore warranting of some consideration. When I first went vegan I had the mindset of “well I don’t recall anyone saying we shouldn’t close down Auschwitz because all those SS officers will lose their jobs, and they have families to feed” but it didn’t take too long for me to realise that this may not be the best outreach technique to use. The issue with farmers is that they are the ones directly enslaving, mutilating and profiting off the exploitation and death of animals and as such, it can be hard for us to want to address the issue of their livelihoods because the most important thing for us is to end the exploitation of animals as quickly as we possibly can. What we have to be considerate of though, is that these farmers are doing a job that they are being demanded to do, they are fulfilling the wishes of the consumer. Now, undeniably there are truly evil farmers who deserve no sympathy or consideration - I’ve spoken to other farmers who agree with this. The issue is most farmers are doing what they are told to do and operate under what is deemed legal, many were also born into farming families and consequently have been conditioned and indoctrinated into a certain way of life and genuinely believe that farming animals is completely ethical and moral. So as vegans we are left with a moral dilemma because we all readily acknowledge that the reason good people perpetuate systems of violence towards animals is because they have been conditioned to do so, but the same logic applies to farmers as well, who have also been conditioned into these same systems of violence. What this fundamentally means, is that farmers need to be given some form of consideration that shows they’re not entirely morally culpable for the life that they have been given and I think an awareness of the fact their jobs are at risk fulfils this need. One thing you can say to the person you are talking to is, “I agree that the issue surrounding the livelihoods of farmers is something that needs addressing but do you think that the life of animals and the planet is more important than money?”. For me this is really what it boils down to, money or life? Obviously, the life of an animal is far more important than money and most people will agree with that, but they need to be asked the questions in order to realise it. So I guess this leads us on to the discussion of what do we do about farmer’s jobs? There are a couple of things that can be done, firstly and most simply farmers can switch to arable farming and produce only plants. This is an entirely plausible solution for some farmers and in fact it has already been done by a number of farmers, including a cattle farmer who recently gave all of ‘his’ herd to Hillside Animal Sanctuary - and he now runs a fully vegan farm. The Vegan Society will offer help and financial support to any farmers who want to make the transition, so that’s always a really good thing to tell the person you are talking to. Another way of supplying the funds to farmers looking to make the transition is through tax subsidies. For me this is probably the most important thing that needs to happen to safeguard farmer’s livelihoods. So currently a proportion of our tax money is given to farmers to help financially support what they do, the issue is though, the majority of the subsidies go straight to dairy and animal farms, which is one of the reasons why animal products remain affordable. If the subsidies were removed it would cause huge problems to those industries. What needs to happen, is the subsidies that are given to animal farming need to instead be put into plant farming, this would drive the price of animal products up, making them less accessible and less affordable and bring the price of plants down, making them more accessible and more affordable. It would also mean that these subsidies could be used to help and financially support animal farmers transition over to plant farming instead. However, there will be farmers who can’t switch to producing plants as their land won’t be suitable for arable farming. This inherently means that they will probably end up losing their job as a farmer, but it was always going to be inevitable that would happen for some farmers. What is most important here is a sense of perspective, a job or a livelihood does not provide moral justification for enslaving, mutilating and profiting off the death of animals and in this situation the hardships of a farmer finding a new job is nothing compared to the life of suffering and fear that animals have to endure in the farming industries. What also strikes me as disingenuous, is for the most part people don’t ever normally care about whether or not their actions are jeopardising the jobs of others. For example, if you use the self-checkout machines in supermarkets you are jeopardising the jobs of the cashiers as their job becomes redundant. Another example that you could say to someone is “would you advocate for everyone to smoke cigarettes because if nobody smoked all the tobacco farmers and people employed within the cigarette industries would lose their jobs and their livelihoods?”. If they say no, you could follow up with “why do you think the job of an animal farmer is more important than the job of a tobacco farmer?”. Furthermore, not everybody is going to stop eating animal products overnight, the shift will be gradual, which means farmers wouldn’t be put out of jobs immediately and this would instead provide the perfect opportunity for them to phase into a different career. Also, when it comes to livelihoods and jobs, it’s only ever farmers that are mentioned, nobody ever expresses a concern for the jobs of slaughterhouse workers. In fact sometimes non-vegans say to me, “how could anyone ever do a job like that?”, or “you have to be a sick person to work in a slaughterhouse.” - that really irritates me as people who work in slaughterhouses generally do so out of necessity, not because they want to - and the only reason those jobs exist is because consumers buy animal products. Slaughterhouse workers are often immigrants or working class people who have little to no other options. They suffer from some of the highest rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicide and drug and alcohol abuse in any profession and suffer huge psychological issues as a result of killing animals. Abolishing animal agriculture would be a liberation for these people as well as for the animals.
