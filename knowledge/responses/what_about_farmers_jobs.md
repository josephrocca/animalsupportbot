The issue of what will happen to traditional farmers jobs if animal agriculture is dramatically changed to eliminate animal cruelty as far as possible is an important one.

On the one hand, while there should be some sympathy for farmers, who like many humans on this earth are just trying to get by and make a living by fulfilling the demand of consumers, it is hard to justify the continued exploitation and needless slaughter of sentient beings in order to support this industry.

In the same way that other unethical practices need to stop, or have stopped - so too must animal agriculture. Is money worth more than the lives of animals and the future of our planet?

There are many such examples of industries which are widely decried for having too great a cost to our society, both in clearly measurable impacts towards most people (climate, public health, pollution), but also in ethical terms too (slavery, child labour).

Should abolitionists be concerned about the employment status of slavers, or rather the welfare of slaves? Should conservationists be concerned about the employment status of elephant tusk poachers, or rather the welfare of the elphants unnecessarily hunted towards extinction? Should the first concern of banning smoking indoors be that of tobacco farmers, or that of the public health?

This line of thinking can be repeated for any industry which has a wider societal or ethical cost (whaling, human trafficking, fracking). 

It is also important to note that not even all the employees of animal agriculture are benefiting from the exploitation of animals. Slaughterhouse workers, employed by farmers, are statistically likely to be immigrants or working class people who have little to no other options [1]. In addition, they suffer from some of the highest rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicide and drug and alcohol abuse in any profession and suffer huge psychological issues as a result of killing animals every single day [2].

Of course, all this ignores the potential for some farmers (who have arable land) to move towards producing only plants while still making a living. Currently, 90% of agricultural subsidies are given towards farmers worldwide are "harmful", in that they "damage people’s health, fuel the climate crisis, destroy nature and drive inequality by excluding smallholder farmers, many of whom are women", according to a UN report [3,4]. The biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, such as beef and milk, received the biggest subsidies. With such governmental support, is it any surprise that farmers are so invested in these industries continuing?

As suggested by this UN report [4], repurposing these benefits away from the "outsized" meat and dairy industry could be a game changer in terms of encouraging farmers away from these practices, and ensuring the future of our planet.
