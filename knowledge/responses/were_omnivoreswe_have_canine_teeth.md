This is without question an excuse that is used a lot to justify exploiting animals and it is one that we have to deal with on a regular basis. Interestingly, the way that I approach this excuse has actually changed a lot from when I first started advocating for veganism. There’s a lot of evidence that shows that we are actually not natural omnivores and are instead much more closely related to herbivores and frugivores - this was the argument that I would always make when discussing the omnivore excuse. The problem I found though, was that the conversation would often lose focus and become only about whether or not we are omnivores, rather than whether or not it is morally justifiable to kill animals. People are indoctrinated their whole life to believe that we are natural omnivores and this was something that I ardently believed for most of my life. I think often when people hear vegans say that we aren’t omnivores it makes them think that we are deluded and ignoring basic biology and then they struggle to see the arguments that we make as being credible. The reality is, it is entirely irrelevant if we are natural omnivores or not, it provides no moral justification for us to exploit animals as just because we can do something, does not mean that it is ethical for us to do it. If someone believes that we are an omnivore then by default that means that we are able to obtain energy and nutrients from plants and as such, we are able to sustain life from plants alone. Consequently, that means that there is no necessity for us to eat animals and because there is no necessity it cannot be morally justified. Ask the person, “if we are natural omnivores, which means that by default we can survive only on plants, how do we then morally justify taking the life of an animal as by your own admission it is unnecessary?”. The canine argument is definitely one of the most amusing justifications that people try and use but before I was a vegan I remember using the canine argument myself and truly believing that my canines made it acceptable for me to pay for someone else to kill an animal on my behalf. The quickest and easiest way of debunking this argument is to point out that a hippopotamus has the largest canines of any land animal and they are entirely herbivorous. Other herbivores with sizeable canine teeth include the gorilla, the saber- toothed deer and camels. Our canines are not capable of tearing raw flesh or killing animals and instead are there so that we can bite into hard, crunchy plants (like apples!). If someone you are talking to brings up the canine teeth argument, ask them, “hippos actually have the largest canine teeth of any land animal and they are entirely herbivorous, do you still think that canines grant you the right to pay someone to kill an animal for you?”. Also, just because we posses a physical ability that allow us to do something doesn’t make that action moral. So just because we can physically put animal products in our mouth and digest them does not therefore mean that it is an ethical thing to do. For example I can physically clench my fist but that doesn’t mean that I am morally justified to then punch someone. Ask the non-vegan using this excuse, “do you think that because we posses a physical attribute that allows us to do something, we are therefore morally justified to do it?”. If they say yes you could then ask, “I can physically clench my fist, does mean that I am morally justified to then punch someone?”. I think it’s also important to look at and know why there is an argument that we are not natural omnivores because it does sometimes come up and it is important to know. So the most important points that I use are that our teeth are flat and blunt and are capable of moving side to side, as a natural herbivores are. Our stomachs have weak hydrochloric acid in them, compared to natural meat eaters who have strong hydrochloric acid and the intestines of an omnivore are 3 times shorter than ours, which is important as animal products are devoid of fibre. Also, if we were naturally meant to kill animals we would be able to do so with ease, but the reality is, if we were given a pig that we had to kill using only our hands and teeth, at best we’d probably give the pig a tickle. But let’s say we did manage to kill the pig, how would we then butcher the pig and eat them? What about the organs, like the intestines and brains, the cartilage, the tendons and ligaments? As a natural animal eater we wouldn’t be picky about the bits of the animal that we ate, the whole animal would look appetising to us. Yet how many news articles or images have we seen where people are outraged because they found a chicken’s brain in the KFC they were eating? True animal eaters don’t find the body parts of the animals they are eating abject, they see the body parts as food - and aren’t repulsed by the gore.
