Because vegans do not consume animal products, there is an assumption that a vegan diet is restrictive. On the contrary, veganism can often lead to exposure to and discovery of a variety of foods whether it’s fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and so forth.

As a vegan, you can eat the plant-based version of foods that you are used to eating as a non-vegan. It is possible and quite common to veganize any non-vegan meal, whether it’s pizza, spaghetti bolognese, mac and cheese, curries, nachos, or burritos. The only difference being that they are not derived from plant sources rather than animals.

Another argument is someone claiming to not be able to be vegan because their culture is not compatible with veganism. Because meat is sometimes a requisite of a dish, they believe that they would not be able to enjoy these meals from their upbringing. However, there are a plethora of recipes online, as well as vegan YouTube influencers of diverse cultural backgrounds, that show how to make vegan versions of traditional meals. Happy Cow[1] is also a useful, crowdsourced platform to find places that offer vegan restaurants or places that offer vegan options around the world.
