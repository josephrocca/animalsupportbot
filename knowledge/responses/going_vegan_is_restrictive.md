Because vegans do not consume animal products, there is an assumption that a vegan diet is restrictive. On the contrary, veganism can often lead to exposure to and discovery of a variety of foods whether it’s fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and so forth. As a vegan, it's possible to eat the plant-based version of foods that you are/were used to eating as a non-vegan. The only difference being that they are derived from plant sources rather than animals.

It is important to consider that not everybody faces the same level of difficulty in changing their diet. For example, people with multiple allergies, inability to digest a wide variety of foods, or sensory-based food avoidance like [ARFID](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/what-is-arfid) will find it much more challenging than the average person to make changes to what they eat - be that for veganism or any other reason.

That is not to say that vegans who deal with allergies[1] and even ARFID[2,3,4] do not exist. Of course, nobody is exactly alike, and fully adopting a vegan diet may not be realistic for some given the circumstances.

What is important to note is that the vast majority of people do not have these barriers to changing one's diet. If such restrictions don't apply to you, the existence of a small minority who have real difficulties in changing their diet does not justify you continuing to participate in something unethical. This is particularly true for those in high-income countries, where food choices are plentiful and a vegan diet is indeed affordable[5].

At the end of the day, going vegan is an ethically grounded choice that tries to align actions with morals. For those who agree that the suffering of sentient beings should be reduced[6], and who want to greatly minimize their personal environmental impact[7], the barrier for making this change is as simple as having an open mind and educating oneself.

An excellent resource for doing so can be found at [Vegan Bootcamp](https://veganbootcamp.org/), which provides all the resources needed to start making that change.
