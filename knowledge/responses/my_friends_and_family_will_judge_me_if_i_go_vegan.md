First of all lets address the friends part of this excuse. People’s friends have no control over the actions or decisions that they make in their life and at no point should friends stop anyone from following their morals and becoming vegan. However, it is important to also note that peer pressure is an incredibly difficult thing to deal with, especially when someone feels like they are being mocked or laughed at. What’s so important to realise though is nobody should ever let the opinions of others stop them from following a way of life that is morally right. I think what makes the friends situation particularly hard is that so many social interactions either revolve around food or at least involve food and as such, people don’t want to isolate themselves from their friends by avoiding situations that involve food. Fortunately, this situation is getting easier all the time as more and more places are introducing vegan options and vegan menus and the concept of veganism is becoming increasingly normalised. There is also a huge community of vegans both online and offline and if someone is struggling with their non-vegan friends or wants to go vegan but is worried about their friends, encourage them to join online vegan groups or to go to vegan meet ups where they can meet likeminded people. So let’s now turn our attention to the family aspect of this excuse. If I had wanted to become a vegan when I still lived at home with my parents it would have been an incredibly difficult time for me to do so. My family, as much as they have no objections to me being vegan apart from the stereotypical worries about my health, have not amused the idea of becoming vegans themselves for many of the reasons this e-book has covered. In regards to people being concerned about their family members questioning their veganism or mocking their ethical choices, I can understand how for some people this can be really difficult. If the person doesn’t live at home anymore then of course their family questioning their desire to become vegan shouldn’t stop them from becoming vegan. However, if the person still lives at home it can make going vegan a lot more difficult than it would be otherwise. I think the hardest part of trying to go vegan around your family is not necessarily their judgements, it’s the fact that you have to watch the people you love actively committing immoral acts in front of you whilst also poisoning their bodies at the same time. If the person you are talking to still lives at home then encourage them to try and show their family why it is they want to go vegan, perhaps ask them if they can show their family documentaries or YouTube videos. You could also encourage them to cook for their family in order to show them that vegan food is delicious, affordable, accessible and healthy. I think a lot of the time parents and family just don’t understand veganism or why someone would want to go vegan, so it’s important that the person is knowledgeable in why they want to go vegan so that they can properly talk to their family about it. Also, remind them to never forget that the pain and suffering the animals go through, the damage animal products do to their health and the environmental crisis we are currently facing are all far too important to be dismissed because of unreceptive friends and family. But most importantly, emphasise to them that there is a huge, supportive community that is always available to offer support, advice and help so if they feel isolated or alone because their friends and family are making them feel uncomfortable, then tell them that they can talk to the community because being vegan means they are never truly on their own.
