When it comes to livestock animals, some people seem to believe that the animals should be grateful for being granted life. This reveals the lack of empathy toward the pervasive abuse experienced by farmed animals their entire lives, up to the point of their untimely deaths.

If applied to a human context, we would not suggest that a child born into an abusive environment should be grateful for being deprived of physical safety or emotional stability. In situations where there is inflicted fear, suffering, and violence toward human beings (or even toward dogs or cats) suggesting that someone should be thankful, especially toward their abusers, is unheard of. It is because empathy is easily extended to humans and domestic animals, but not toward farmed animals such as chickens, cows, pigs, and sheep. 

Given that farmed animals are exploited, abused, and then slaughtered at the hands of humans, demanding a sense of gratitude suggests that humans are a benevolent species. Do you think that a pig whose entire life is spent in confinement, with huge periods of time trapped inside a farrowing crate too small for her to even move, should be grateful?[1] Or that a dairy cow who is taken away from her mother, forcibly and repeatedly impregnated, and whose children are taken away from her should be thankful?[2] Such violent practices, including but not limited to rape, castration, mutilation, and being ground up alive[3], are inflicted across various species of farmed animals, all over the world.

The life granted to these farmed animals can barely even be called a life, much less one worth being grateful for. Could you go into a slaughterhouse, look an animal in the eye as they are about to be killed, and tell them that they should be thanking you for their hellish life?
