When it comes to livestock animals people seem to use the excuse, “if it wasn’t for us these animals would never have been given a life, they should be grateful.” - let’s start by applying this logic to humans. If a child is born into an abusive family, where he or she is regularly beaten, is never fed and eventually dies from all the abuse, would we think “well at least that child’s parents gave them a chance to experience life?” Or, how about a Syrian child who has only ever known violence and fear. He sees his family killed by war and in an attempt to escape from the literal hell of his existence joins other refugees in making the dangerous journey into Europe by boat. But the boat sinks in the ocean and the child, scared and confused as to why such a horrible existence had been given to him, drowns. Should that child be grateful for the fact that they had the chance to exist? Would we be grateful? What about a woman who is born into human trafficking and spends her whole life being prostituted, should she be grateful to her captors? What about non-human animals? If I breed dogs into existence and then I mutilate, abuse and kill them, am I a good person for giving those dogs an experience of life in the first place? If I breed cats and then lock them in metal boxes that they can’t escape from, never allow them to go outside or breathe fresh air and then hang them upside down and cut their throats, am I now a morally righteous person, because without me those cats would never have been alive? Ask the people you are talking to those questions. Put the animals that we love in the position of the animals that we eat and ask whether we are still good people for giving them an experience of life. I find this excuse to be an incredibly arrogant one as it’s an excuse that only the oppressor could ever use. It’s an excuse that only someone who is living a comfortable life could use, because nobody who has experienced genuine suffering would ever claim that someone should be grateful for a life of pain. The simplest and most obvious way of deducing whether this is a good argument is to tap into our empathy. To really understand whether the so called ‘life’ we are giving to these animals is such a favour we need only put ourselves in their position. Put it this way, you’re given the opportunity to exist, but in return you will be taken away from your mother, be forcibly impregnated repeatably and each time you give birth you will have your children taken away from you. You will be in unrelenting pain, get excruciating infections and be abused by the people that hold you captive. When you are finally too weak to carry on, you collapse before being dragged to your own death, where you are hung upside down, have your throat slit and bleed to death. Would you accept that life? Would you be grateful and say “thank you, how kind. If it wasn’t for you I would never be given this wonderful opportunity!”. This excuse is used as if the animals that we raise to exploit, abuse and slaughter should be grateful, as if we are some benevolent, selfless species that deserves praise for all of our good deeds. Do you think that a pig whose entire life is spent in confinement, with huge periods of time trapped inside a farrowing crate too small for her to even move or turn around in, should be grateful? Would you be grateful, watching your children being taken away from you and mutilated in front of you? What about being castrated and having your body parts chopped off, now do you feel indebted to the oppressors that created you? These are all questions you can put to non-vegans when they state that animals should be grateful for being brought into this world by humans. The life that we give to these animals can barely even be called a life, in the eyes of these animals, they are in hell. They have nothing to feel grateful for. We do the most evil and unimaginably horrific things to these innocent creatures. We treat them as objects that we have dominion over, we inflict unspeakable violence onto them and yet we still have the audacity to say that they should be grateful to us for the life that we give them. The egg-laying hen kept in a cage should be grateful. The calf murdered for dairy should be grateful. The coyote killed for fur should be grateful. The pig killed in a gas chamber should be grateful. The cow that has a knife against their throat should be grateful. The fish dragged out of the ocean should be grateful. The animals tested on in laboratories should be grateful. The only time any of these animals feel a sense of gratitude is when their life is over and the pain and suffering inflicted upon them is over. The only gratitude these animals will ever feel is knowing that they’ll never again have to look into the eyes of the species that thinks it’s okay to treat them as commodities. Ask the person who uses this excuse, “do you think you could go to a slaughterhouse look an animal in they eye as they are about to be killed and tell them that they should be thanking you for their life?”
