Most consumers of animal products declare that they care about the wellbeing of animals and even go so far as to agree that the way we raise and kill animals is cruel. This is partly why many people choose to pay extra for free-range eggs and organic animal products. I was the same before I was vegan, I would always buy free-range eggs as I believed that the hens had lived a happy and fulfilled life. In fact, if people tell you that they buy free-range, or choose to buy animal products that are labelled as being high welfare, this can actually be a point that can be used in our favour, as it shows the person does have compassion for animals on some level. But let’s see, does the ‘humane’, ‘high-welfare’, ‘RSPCA-Assured’, ‘local’, ‘organic’ excuse morally justify exploiting and killing an animal? Well, taking an egg-laying hen out of a cage and into an overcrowded barn is about as helpful to the chicken as giving a prisoner a pillow to put his head on whilst he’s being waterboarded and labelling him as a ‘humanely tortured prisoner’. Jeffrey Dahmer was a serial killer who drugged his victims before he killed them, so in reality the people he killed weren’t aware they were going to die, they didn’t suffer and they didn’t feel pain (where have we heard those phrases before?) - does that mean he was a humane serial killer? Was he a high-welfare, ethical murderer? The reality is, it doesn’t matter what privilege or treatment the animals receive, if they are destined to be killed, exploited or abused in anyway then there is no ethical or humane way in which to treat these animals. The only humane method of slaughter is to not slaughter. The only happy chickens are the chickens that get to live a free life, truly free, not free-range. Humane slaughter is an oxymoron, as is high welfare murder, or happy exploitation. Now there is of course an argument that improving treatment for animals is better than keeping it the way it is, in the same way that taking paracetamol for a broken arm is better than not taking anything, but it’s not going to make the problem go away and it certainly doesn’t provide any real relief. In fact, what these welfare changes actually do is ease the conscience of the consumer, which is very dangerous as not only does it reinforce the idea that there is an ethical way to exploit an animal but it allows the consumer to buy a product and think that in doing so they are giving an animal a happy life. This is why it’s so important we don’t perpetuate these notions of welfare because to do so is an injustice to the animal who is still suffering. It’s important that when we are talking to non-vegans we have clear message that states “there is no right way to do the wrong thing” and if someone mentions free-range eggs or something similar, say something a long the lines of, “buying free-range eggs shows you care about animals, however did you know that free-range is sadly a marketing ploy as the animals are raised in huge barns where the vast majority are denied access to fresh air and sunlight - and the male chicks are still ground up alive and ultimately all of the hens still end up being slaughtered?”. Free-range is a deceitful attempt by the egg industry to lure customers into believing their product is more ethical and morally righteous than caged eggs and in doing so they can charge more money for the product. High welfare is a scam to make people think that the animal lived a happy, good life but as we all know, it doesn’t matter what label is on the product, the animal died in the same slaughterhouse using the same method as all the other animals on the shelves. In fact ask the person you are talking to about this, say “are the animals raised on small local farms taken to different slaughterhouses, or are they killed in the same way factory farmed animals are?”. The issue is, it doesn’t matter how nice a life an animal has, the moment we exploit them for what is rightfully theirs and eventually take them to the slaughterhouse or to the yard to kill them, that is abuse. Animals don’t want bigger cages or larger barns, they don’t care whether or not they’re grass-fed, or organic. They don’t want to be RSPCA-Assured or Red Tractor Approved, because those labels are there for us, the consumer, to ease our conscience. All the animals want is to be free, truly free. Not free-range, not free to pasture 4 - 6 months of the year. Free to live their lives in their entirety, without fear of human inflicted pain, suffering or exploitation. It always strikes me as strange that when people campaign against eating dogs in Yulin, they don’t campaign for the animals to be kept in bigger cages, or to be free- range. Nobody ever asks for the dogs to be killed in a more humane way. We demand that the festival be abolished. If it was RSPCA-Assured labrador steaks would that be acceptable? What about Red Tractor approved minced poodle? The purposefully misleading marketing terminology printed on animal products holds no veracity compared to the actual treatment of the animal who was exploited, murdered and packaged up neatly for consumers to eat free of any guilt or culpability. I think it’s really important to highlight these points to any non-vegan who says we should improve conditions or states that they buy animal products from happy farms or humane slaughterhouses. You could always ask the person you are talking to, “can we humanely kill an animal?” - this is actually one of my favourite questions. If the person believes there is a humane way to kill an animal, remind them that the word humane means “having or showing compassion or benevolence”, so re-phrase the question and ask, “how do we compassionately, benevolently or humanely take the life of an animal that does not want to die for an unnecessary reason?”. So now let’s consider improving the welfare of animals from an economic perspective. The monetary system that we have in place, capitalism, ensures that we exist in a system that values profits and economic gain. Do we really believe that a system that teaches people that it’s acceptable to exploit other humans and indeed our environment for their own gain is going to invest potential profits into securing high- welfare standards for animals? If humans are treated as a commodity by the corporations and big businesses then how can we plausibly allow ourselves to be brainwashed into believing that animals will be treated with respect and decency? But as we’ve already established, if we’re using an animal for our own gain, we are by default not treating them with respect and decency. So if the corporations aren’t going to invest their money into improving welfare standards that would mean that the price of animal products would have to rise and the consumer would have to pay extra. Most people simply aren’t able to pay extra for their food and many won’t when they don’t have to. Furthermore, if we did move towards a system of “idyllic” family farming, with grass-fed free-range animals, it would just simply not be environmentally sustainable to meet the world’s demand for animal products. There is simply not enough space on the surface of the planet. What this would also mean is that animal products would only become available for the rich and wealthy, making it a luxury and highly sought after product. This is one of the reasons why I really frown upon organisations like Compassion in World Farming, as their end goal not only still means animals are suffering but it is inherently classist, as it creates a world where the rich and wealthy are able to buy products that most of society can’t - and it takes us back to the days where eating animals was a sign of financial dominance. So to conclude, even if we did somehow improve the standards of welfare for factory farmed animals, whatever kind of paradox that may be, that would still not justify continuing to consume animal products.
