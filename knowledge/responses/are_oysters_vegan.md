**The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?** Veganism is about trying to exclude, as much as possible and practicable, the suffering of animals from our daily life. So naturally, the question of whether or not it is vegan to eat oysters concerns an oyster's ability to suffer.

**Pain helps us protect ourselves, it is only useful in beings that are able to move.** It is important to first understand the evolutionary utility of pain and why we feel pain. Try touching something really really hot, like a pot holding boiling water. Your hand will reflexively withdraw from the hot and painful stimulus. This is a reflex that doesn't even go through your brain, it's literally automatic, the signal goes to your spinal court and it sends out a command to withdraw your arm. Imagine a world in which you are a tree, you are not able to move, in this scenario, feeling pain is of no benefit to you. You will not be able to avoid danger _anyway_. And indeed, when we look at the biology of living beings, organisms that are able to move and react to their environment have a nervous system where as organisms that cannot do not.

[**Oysters have a nervous system**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896133/). Clams, oysters, scallops can [swim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6wGwKEdT8&ab_channel=EastCoastDivers), [hear](https://poseidonsweb.com/oysters-can-hear-sounds-and-it-may-be-important/), [see](https://poseidonsweb.com/your-scallops-are-probably-watching-you/), and [burrow](https://poseidonsweb.com/bivalve-mollusks-oysters-scallops-clams-oh-my/). There is no reason to suppose that they absolutely cannot feel pain or discomfort. Science is not 100% certain that oysters don’t feel pain, just that they don’t feel pain in the way that you or I, or many animals, feel pain.

[**We were once so sure that babies don't feel pain that we operated on them without anesthesia.**](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150421084812.htm) There is an inherent problem in choosing to only recognize _our type of pain as the only type of pain_. It makes us do horrible things to others just because we are not smart enough to understand their suffering. The kinder thing to do is to give beings the benefit of the doubt and err on the side of caution and realize that there are more variations in nature that we currently understand.
