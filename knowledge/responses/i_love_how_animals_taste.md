The reason why people eat animal products is because they enjoy the taste; in fact, most vegans loved the taste of animal products before going vegan. But sensory pleasure is a poor excuse. It bluntly admits that an individual’s taste preference matters more than the morality surrounding an animal’s life and unquestionably horrific death.  

The question is: do you value your taste buds higher than the life of an animal? And it is not only about the taking of the animal's life. To reach your plate and give you a few minutes of pleasure, animals are forcefully bred, constantly abused, genetically modified, and are finally taken to slaughterhouses where they witness their peers being killed one by one [1,2].

If you think that a few minutes of pleasure justifies the immense cruelty these sentient beings are made to suffer, you'd need to think what else can be justified by pleasure alone. Would this argument hold up in court if a murderer, in their own defense, said that they could never give up murdering because of pleasure? 

It requires more than sensory pleasure to morally justify an action. The difficulty or inconvenience of forgoing an animal product from one's diet is minuscule compared to the pain, suffering, and fear that animals have to go through. A meal may last for 15 minutes, but the abuse of an animal lasts through their lives and up until their untimely death. What food could ever be worth taking the life of an individual? The scariest thing we can think of is being tortured and ultimately murdered. Yet, this is the reality of trillions of animals who are slaughtered for food each year [3].
