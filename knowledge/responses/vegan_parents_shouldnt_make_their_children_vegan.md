**Veganism is suitable and healthy for all stages of life.** Says the [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0002-8223(01)00167-5), [Canada's Food Guide](https://www.cps.ca/documents/position/vegetarian-diets), [American Dietetic Association](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19562864/), and [many more](https://youaretheirvoice.com/pages/the-clear-consensus). The concensus of the scientific community is that veganism is suitable and healthy for all stages of life. While veganism is still a fairly new concept and it's rare to run across someone who has been vegan their entire lives, we know of several prominent individuals who fit this bill, such as pro bodybuilder [Jehina Malik](https://www.instagram.com/ifbbprojehina/?hl=en) and fashion entrepreneurs [Meg and Komie Vora](https://www.instagram.com/delikaterayne/?hl=en). Given all this, it is clear that on the health perspective, veganism is at least as viable a dietary option for children as non-veganism.

**Veganism is a moral philosophy and it is part of parenting to teach your children ethics and morality.** Is a parent responsible for teaching their children to not abuse animals? Should a parent enforce that their children are not allowed to kick dogs, for example? What about that their children are not allowed to bully other children? Or are parents supposed to let their children be and say, well, I'll let my children make up their own minds about bullying, if they want to bully people, that's their choice? As stated by [the Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/): _Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals._ 

**Children will suffer the brunt of our inaction on Climate Change.** By adopting a vegan diet, [one can reduce their dietary greenhouse emissions by a whopping 60%](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1). In fact, due to the devastating impact of animal agriculture on biodiversity, rainforest deforestation, pollution, and climate change, it is found that [eliminating animal products can be the single biggest thing an individual can do to help the planet](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987). Many have argued that the actual single biggest thing is to not have children, but that naturally also means that having vegan children is more helpful than having non-vegan children. To not teach children the impacts of a diet filled with animal products and to raise them to consume animal products is to rob them of crucial information that can empower them to do the best they can with the earth we have left for them.
