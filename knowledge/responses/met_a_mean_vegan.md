Vegans are a diverse group of people containing folks from all walks of life. One negative interaction with a single vegan person does not mean that all vegans are mean nor does it invalidate the entire movement. Dismissing the merits of veganism based on a measure of character is an ad hominem fallacy [1]. This means that you are making your decision based on some flaw in the person you interacted with and not on the facts presented.

People naturally get defensive when told they're doing something wrong, but it is important to consider the veracity of those words instead of latching onto the instinctive feeling of not liking the messenger. 

People also tend to get uncomfortable when their privileges and participation in oppression systems are pointed out to them. Vegans are speaking out for victims, and that means calling out people who are active participants of a system of oppression called carnism [2]. One’s perception of someone being mean may also be a natural defense mechanism of being called out on one’s complicit behavior. By the very nature of the movement, veganism requires people to recognize one’s complicitness in the unnecessary torture and murder of billions of sentient beings [3]. Learning about these facts and one’s participation in carnism does not feel good, but that feeling should be cause for self reflection. 

Making the decision to do the right thing shouldn’t be based on whether a person in that group is “nice.” Reach out to other vegans around you for support in making lifestyle changes or to ask questions. If you are unable to find that support group, become the change you want to see and become that nice helpful vegan.
