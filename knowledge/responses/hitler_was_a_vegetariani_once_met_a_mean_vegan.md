Of all the excuses that meat eaters use to invalidate veganism this one is possibly the most unusual. I’ve grouped the ‘but Hitler was a vegetarian’ excuse with the ‘I once knew a vegan who wasn’t very nice’ because they both revolve around dismissing an entire movement and philosophy of life based on the actions of an individual. First and foremost, Hitler wasn’t a vegetarian, I believe some of these ideas came about because Goebbels wanted to make Hitler seem likeable by creating comparisons between him and Gandhi, who was a vegetarian. But that fact is neither here nor there when addressing the question because even if Hitler was a vegetarian, what exactly would that prove? The idea behind this argument is that because one of the most evil men in history, who committed vile atrocities, cared about animals, then by being vegan you too will probably undervalue humans as a consequence of your views towards animals. Quite obviously this excuse is beyond absurd. Chairman Mao, Mussolini and Stalin all ate meat and committed unforgivable crimes. So by the logic of the ‘but Hitler argument’, vegans could say you better become vegan because Stalin ate animals and if you eat animals you'll be just like Stalin. If you are ever in a situation where someone actually uses this argument genuinely, I would first suggest that you take a moment to pause and take a deep breath, then say “actually Hitler wasn’t a vegetarian, but even if he was how does that morally justify you eating animals and their secretions?”. You could also remind them that you are vegan, not vegetarian - and that you oppose the philosophy of vegetarianism as it perpetuates the needless slaughter of both dairy cows, male chicks and egg-laying hens. If you think about it, fascists believe that they are superior to others based on entirely superfluous notions of heritage, ethnicity, sexuality, etc. Likewise, people eat animals for entirely superfluous notions as well. Now, obviously non-vegans aren’t necessarily fascists but if there are comparisons being made, slaughtering trillions of animals for an entirely unnecessary and immoral reason is much more in line with the behaviour of the Nazis than eating plants and advocating for all life to be treated with respect and compassion is. Needless to say, I would not recommend insinuating that the person you are talking to is in anyway a Nazi or a fascist! But nonetheless, the Hitler excuse seeks to set up an association between not eating animals and being evil, which can be a dangerous comparison to draw if someone was to believe that Hitler was actually a vegetarian. But to any rational minded individual, it is quite clearly a ridiculous argument as it could be just as easily argued by this logic that because Hitler brushed his teeth or used a car anyone who does either of those things is by default a psychopath. I think the real issue with this excuse is that it attempts to demonise the vegan movement by associating it with the complete opposite of what it really stands for and for this reason I find this excuse more than just the outlandish argument it first seems. So let’s take this excuse and focus on the next element of it, which is “but I once knew a vegan who wasn’t very nice to me”. This argument follows the same idea that because someone who was vegan wasn’t very nice, they therefore invalidate the entire movement and everyone who is a part of it. Now for obvious reasons this logic is very flawed. For instance, I was once shouted at by a ticket inspector on a train in Hungary because there was a misunderstanding surrounding my ticket. Does that now mean I am morally justified to believe that all Hungarian men are not very nice? Or does that mean every ticket inspector on every train isn’t very nice? I once had an altercation with a lady in New York who told me she hated British people, I must now be morally justified to not like all New Yorkers, or even all women? The reality is, we have all had bad experiences with people at some point in our life, but to then believe that you can look down upon or judge on an entire demographic of people based on that one experience is obviously not logical in the slightest. Say that to the person you are talking to - “do you think it is sensible to judge an entire demographic of people based on the actions of one individual?”.
