**<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/21/opinion/l-don-t-put-hitler-among-the-vegetarians-800991.html">Hitler wasn’t a vegetarian</a>** Some of these ideas came about because Goebbels wanted to make Hitler seem likeable by creating comparisons between him and Gandhi, who was a vegetarian. But that fact is neither here nor there when addressing the question because even if Hitler was a vegetarian, what exactly would that prove?  Even if he was how does that morally justify you eating animals and their secretions?

**Plenty of evil men, including Hitler, ate animals and animal products too** The idea behind this argument is that because one of the most evil men in history, who committed vile atrocities, cared about animals, then by being vegan you too will probably undervalue humans as a consequence of your views towards animals. Quite obviously this excuse is beyond absurd. Chairman Mao, Mussolini and Stalin all ate meat and committed unforgivable crimes. So by the logic of the ‘but Hitler argument’, vegans could say you better become vegan because Stalin ate animals and if you eat animals you'll be just like Stalin. 

**Fascists believe that they are superior to others based on arbritrary notions of race, veganism rejects the notion that we are arbritrarily superior to non-human animals** If you think about it, fascists believe that they are superior to others based on entirely superfluous notions of heritage, ethnicity, sexuality, etc. Likewise, people eat animals for entirely superfluous notions as well. Now, obviously non-vegans aren’t necessarily fascists but if there are comparisons being made, slaughtering trillions of animals for an entirely unnecessary and immoral reason is much more in line with the behaviour of the Nazis than eating plants and advocating for all sentient life to be treated with respect and compassion is. 

**Vegetarianism is not Veganism** Being vegan is not being vegetarian. Vegetarianism as it is perpetuates the needless abuse and slaughter of both dairy cows, male calves, male chicks and egg-laying hens.
