I think of all the excuses used against veganism this is actually a very important one and something that as vegans we need to be aware of. It is absolutely true that it is almost impossible to be 100% vegan in this world - for example the production and harvesting of crops does cause the death of animals like aphids, caterpillars, moths, worms, flies, locusts - and even birds, mice and rats. Where this argument falls apart is that it is used to suggest that if you can’t be 100% vegan there’s no point in trying at all, or more to the point because animals sometimes die in crop production it is therefore acceptable for us to breed, raise and kill animals intentionally. By this argument a fireman could be at a burning building about to go in and save a baby but then he realises that there’s also another person in there that he can’t save. So he decides that since he cannot save both, there is no point in saving either of them and leaves the baby to burn to death. Or a coastguard sees a group of drowning children but realises that it won’t be possible to save all of them, so he allows them all to drown instead of trying to save any of them. It’s like me saying, “well I can never be a truly 100% morally just person, so why bother trying to be a good person in the slightest?”. Or, “well I’m not a kind person all the time so why bother being kind at all?”. What this argument really boils down to is intention. When we buy animal products we are intentionally paying for someone to exploit and kill an animal, when we buy plants we are not. If an animal dies in the production of plants that is unintentional and as we can all agree, entirely regrettable. If someone was driving their car and they accidentally hit a dog, that would not be the same as if they purposefully drove after the dog until they ran them over. The logic behind the argument “it’s morally justifiable for me to pay for an animal to be killed because animals sometimes die in crop production” is stating that morally, accidentally hitting the dog is the same as purposefully hitting the dog, as it ignores the intention. It also states that because animals are sometimes killed accidentally by cars, it is therefore acceptable to purposefully run them over. When talking to a non-vegan who uses this excuse, ask them “morally, is there a difference between accidentally hitting a dog with your car and purposefully hitting a dog with your car?”. When they say yes, then ask them “so by that logic is there morally a difference between an animal accidentally being killed in crop production and an animal purposefully being killed in a slaughterhouse?”. Also, make sure to remember that vastly more plants are used in the production of animal products than they are vegan products, so be sure to say “if you care about the animals that are killed in crop production you should be vegan because vastly more plants are needed to create animal products, which means vastly more animals are killed in crop production for non-vegans than they are for vegans.”. This excuse also misses one of the biggest points of veganism, which is that we don’t need to eat animals or their secretions to live, hence why we don’t. The reason that insects and small animals die in crop production is not because we all want to eat them but because we do need to eat plants in order to sustain a healthy life. Ultimately, veganism is about minimising the damage done to animals as much as is possible and practicable, it’s not about being perfect. I think non-vegans often try and paint veganism as a pursuit for perfection as it makes it seem completely unobtainable, idealistic and not grounded in reality.
