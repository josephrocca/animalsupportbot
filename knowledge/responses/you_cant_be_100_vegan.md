I think of all the excuses used against veganism this is actually a very important one and something that as vegans we need to be aware of. It is absolutely true that it is almost impossible to be 100% vegan in this world - for example the production and harvesting of crops does cause the death of animals like aphids, caterpillars, moths, worms, flies, locusts - and even birds, mice and rats. 

Where this argument falls apart is that it is used to suggest that if you can’t be 100% vegan there’s no point in trying at all, or more to the point because animals sometimes die in crop production it is therefore acceptable for us to breed, raise and kill animals intentionally. By this argument a fireman could be at a burning building about to go in and save a baby but then he realises that there’s also another person in there that he can’t save. So he decides that since he cannot save both, there is no point in saving either of them and leaves the baby to burn to death. Or a coastguard sees a group of drowning children but realises that it won’t be possible to save all of them, so he allows them all to drown instead of trying to save any of them. 

It’s like me saying, “well I can never be a truly 100% morally just person, so why bother trying to be a good person in the slightest?”. Or, “well I’m not a kind person all the time so why bother being kind at all?”. 

What this argument really boils down to is intention. When we buy animal products we are intentionally paying for someone to exploit and kill an animal, when we buy plants we are not. If an animal dies in the production of plants that is unintentional and as we can all agree, entirely regrettable. If someone was driving their car and they accidentally hit a dog, that would not be the same as if they purposefully drove after the dog until they ran them over. 

The logic behind the argument “it’s morally justifiable for me to pay for an animal to be killed because animals sometimes die in crop production” [See note below] is stating that morally, accidentally hitting the dog is the same as purposefully hitting the dog, as it ignores the intention. It also states that because animals are sometimes killed accidentally by cars, it is therefore acceptable to purposefully run them over. 

[Note]: By the way, less than half of the world's cereals are fed directly to humans [1]. 41% of the world's crops are fed to animals (which when killed and consumed provide less calories than the original plants they have been fed over their lifetimes), so the amount of field mice etc killed in crop production would actually reduce if we all stopped eating animals.
