Is eating animals a personal choice, or is it a little more complex than that? 

All acts come from personal choices. Some are inconsequential, whereas others have direct impact on those who will suffer from that choice. It is your choice to eat animals. But by this logic it would then be morally justifiable to beat a dog or kick a cat, as it is a personal choice to do so. 

If someone makes the personal choice to abuse a dog, does that make it morally justifiable? You may not realize it, but you are speaking about non-human animals as they were not sentient beings. As such, they will receive the full harm of your choice—in the same way a dog would suffer if you decided to kick them. There is no difference between a dog, a cat, and a farmed animal when it comes to their capacity to feel pain, despair, terror, and fear [1].

And remember, eating animals causes harm to humans too. Slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants  affect the livelihood of workers who are subjected to poor compensation, safety issues, psychological trauma—all of these which issues which hurt poor and marginalized communities [2].

A personal choice will often affect others' personal choices too. When you declare it's your personal choice to eat animal products, you are not considering the personal choice of other creatures whose lives are treated as inferior and meaningless. Rather, their lives are reduced to minutes of sensory pleasure that can easily be obtained from more ethical plant-based sources.
