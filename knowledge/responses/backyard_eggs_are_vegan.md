**Whether an egg comes from a factory or a backyard, the egg still came from an animal. Therefore, it is not vegan.** Veganism is about redefining our relationship with animals. The realization that we should not value an animal's life based on what it can provide for us is one of the main concepts of veganism. A bee makes honey, a cow produces milk, and a hen lays eggs, but that does not mean it is for a human to take.

**Purchasing a hen from a breeder or farmer still monetarily contributes to the problem with the egg industry.** Male chicks are useless in the egg industry. From the moment the eggs hatch, the males are identified and killed. The most common method used to kill male chicks is through the use of industrial grinders. [This](https://youtu.be/4yaOVvzkyA8list=PLtc3iQTP5EZ8aCW1DoNj36M6dxgc2QWGk) is what happens every day to millions of male chicks on day 1 of their lives.

Another method used to kill both male chicks and hens is the gas chamber. As hens age, egg production declines, and they no longer economically profitable.

**Hens have been selectively bred over the years for maximum egg output with no regard to their health.** For [reference](https://theminimalistvegan.com/backyard-eggs/), a wild hen ordinarily lays less than 20 eggs per year for reproduction. Through selective breeding, hens were producing about 120 eggs a year by 1905. Today, a commercial egg-laying hen can produce up to 350 eggs per year. 

**The loss of nutrients caused by abnormal amounts of egg-laying is detrimental to the health of a hen.** Calcium, which is stored in the bones, is needed to propagate the shell of an egg. A study by [HSUS](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/hsus-report-breeding-egg-welfiss.pdf) estimated that up to 89% of commercial egg-laying hens suffered from osteoporosis. The sheer amount of eggs a hen lays in a year leaves them susceptible to bone fractures, chronic pain, paralysis, egg binding, egg yolk peritonitis, and death.

**Having hens with the intention of taking their eggs means they must produce for their lives to have any value.** Hens will commonly eat their eggs, which can replenish nutrients lost in the egg-laying process. Hen owners who keep hens for their eggs will view that as unproductive and cull them to keep the others from learning the same behavior. That is no different from what the egg industry does when a hen stops producing eggs. Similar to how we want our dogs and cats to live long and happy lives. We should not view other animals as objects available for us to exploit. Instead, we should regard all animals as self-governing beings that deserve to live just as much as we do.
