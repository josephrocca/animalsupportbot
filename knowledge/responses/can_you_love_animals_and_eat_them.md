We live in a world of animal lovers, nobody or at least virtually nobody would say they don’t like animals. Practically everyone agrees that animal cruelty is wrong and those that commit animal cruelty should be punished. This is why we have laws in place protecting the rights of animals, or at least certain animals. But how can a world of animal lovers be the same world that also believes that the deaths of over 56 billion land animals and as many as 2.7 trillion marine animals a year is not only acceptable but actively support its continuance, believing it is morally justifiable? So can you love animals and eat them? The answer is no, of course you can’t, because the two ideas juxtapose one another. Saying you love animals whilst eating their bodies and secretions is like saying “of course I can love my child and beat them”. If an abusive parent said that they loved their child but were also beating them we would think they were a psychopath. This demonstrates the disturbing psychology and paradoxical ideology we have as a collective society of ‘animal lovers’ who are in fact animal eaters. To put this another way, if you love someone the last thing you want to happen to them is for them to be forcibly impregnated, tortured, murdered and eaten, let alone pay for these things to happen to them. If you love someone then you want to avoid bad things happening to them at all costs, so if you love animals then by default the last thing you would ever want is to see their murdered body parts on a plate in front of you. This can even be put in simpler terms. If you are talking to an animal eater and they have a companion animal like a dog, ask them if it would be possible to love their dog if they mutilated and murdered him/her. To be a lover of animals is to love, respect and show compassion to them, all of them, not just the ones society tells you to love. To truly be an animal lover, you have to acknowledge that all animals are worthy of life and deserve to live that life free from human oppression. So no, the excuse you can love animals and eat them is not a valid justification for someone to eat animals, in fact it’s not even possible. When a non-vegan claims to be an animal lover, explain their hypocrisy to them, simply say “can you really be an animal lover if you pay for animals to be hurt?” - chances are they’ve never thought about their relationship with animals in this way before.
