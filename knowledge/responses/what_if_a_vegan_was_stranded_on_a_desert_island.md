The desert island excuse is without doubt a firm favourite for many non-vegans and I hear that due to the booming number of vegans winding up on desert islands there’s actually now a really successful falafel and hummus pop up. The idea of this excuse is that it seeks to create the illusion of hypocrisy in veganism. Non-vegans that use this excuse want to come to the conclusion that in a life or death situation, even a vegan would value his or her own life above that of an animal’s and therefore it is morally justifiable for them to continuing consuming animal products. Obviously, if someone was stranded on a desert island, vegan or not, they would seek to find fruits and vegetables first and if there were animals roaming around that we could kill, there would also presumably be vegetation that we could eat as well. Let’s be honest, if anyone did just randomly get stranded on a desert island their chance of survival would be incredibly low. Even if there was an animal there, most of us wouldn’t know how to kill them, butcher them and cook them, for this reason I would become friends with the animal. At least that way I would have a friendship and someone to spend time with as I slowly died from starvation and lack of clean drinking water. On a serious note, nobody can really judge what they’d do in a survival situation and there have been documented cases where humans have eaten each other in order to survive. The most important thing here however, is that just because humans have killed and eaten other humans for survival, doesn’t mean it is moral for us to kill and eat each other in a normal environment. This is really the main point of the rebuttal, because even if someone was forced to kill and eat an animal in a life or death situation, this provides no moral justification for eating animal products in everyday life. The reality is, we are not stuck on a desert island and therefore we do not need to kill and eat an animal out of necessity. We do however, live in a society where we are surrounded by an abundance of vegan foods, so morally this argument proves nothing. By creating an environment or a situation where every choice or possibility is an unsavoury one, non-vegans are trying to find solace for the fact their diet causes unnecessary and unjustifiable suffering to another living being. The desert island excuse is a way of reaffirming the myth that we need to eat animals to survive by creating an extreme situation with no satisfactory moral choices, and then transposing the conduct that one would find acceptable to commit on a desert island into everyday society. In essence it comes down to this, none of us are stranded on a desert island so the excuse is redundant and there is no moral correlation between killing an animal out of necessity in a life or death situation and killing an animal for nothing other than greed and selfish desire. The real question and the question you should ask the non-vegan you are in conversation with is, “why would you allow the destruction of our planet to continue, the needless slaughter of innocent animals to continue, the death of starving children to continue and the deterioration of your own health to continue when it is entirely unnecessary?” .
