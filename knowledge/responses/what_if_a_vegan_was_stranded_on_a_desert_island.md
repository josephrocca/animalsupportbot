Ultimately, none of us reading Reddit right now are stuck on desert islands where we need to kill out of necessity. We do however, live in a society where we are surrounded by an abundance of vegan foods, and there is no similarity between having to kill an animal out of necessity in a life or death situation and killing an animal for nothing more than taste pleasure.

In the real world, and not some unrealistic hypothetical, human consumption of animal products leads to the very real degradation of the environment and exacerbation of climate change[1]. In the real world, industrial farming kills, mutilates, and grinds up sentient beings by the billions every single year [2]. 

All this is completely avoidable, as it is possible to remove animal products from one's diet while still meeting all nutritional goals[3] and while also often being cheaper to do so[4].
