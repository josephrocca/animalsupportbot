Hey, I totally understand your frustration there, there's been a lot of sensationalist headlines about PETA being this mass-murdering killing machine that's completely hypocritical of it's goal... however, as one would probably guess, catchy news titles and life in general is never as black and white as we'd be led to believe.

Here's something of a quick overview read:

Here's some other resources that go over what PETA actually does and why they do it, I hope you can take some time to read into it as while I don't agree with PETA's marketing and advertising, they do do a lot of good around the world. That's why Peter and other GOT actors have partnered with PETA to spread that message. Hope this helps mate.

Jonathan Safran Foer on PETA from Eating Animals:

<i>Whatever one thinks of them, no organization strikes fear in the factory farm industry and its allies more than PETA. They are effective. When PETA targeted fast-food companies, the most famous and powerful welfare scientist in the country, Temple Grandin (who has designed more than half the cattle slaughter facilities in the nation), said she saw more improvement in welfare in one year than she had seen in her entire thirty-year career previously. Arguably the biggest PETA hater on the planet, Steve Kopperud (a meat industry consultant who has given anti-PETA seminars for a decade), puts it this way: “There’s enough understanding in the industry now of what PETA’s capable of to put the fear of God into many executives.” It didn’t surprise me to learn that companies of all kinds regularly negotiate with PETA and quietly make changes in their animal welfare policies to avoid being publicly targeted by the group.</i>
