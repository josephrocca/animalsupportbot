When confronted with the idea that the consumption of animals is done purely for the taste rather than for nutrition (see nutrition) one of the most common excuses vegans hear is, “but animals eat other animals, so why shouldn’t we?” As much as this may be true, some animals do indeed eat other animals, there’s many reasons as to why this statement holds no veracity whatsoever. We need only first consider the anatomical biology of omnivores compared to that of humans. Firstly, omnivores have sharp claws and huge fangs compared to our hands and blunt, ineffective canines. When was the last time you saw a human running on all fours ripping the flesh off a living animal? Omnivores also have short intestines, ideal for digesting flesh, whilst humans have incredibly long intestines, which are useless at digesting flesh - hence the constipation and colon cancer! The acid contained within omnivore and carnivore stomachs is very strong hydrochloric acid, ideal for the digestion of raw animal flesh, which when compared to the weak acid found in our stomachs, explains why we are susceptible to food poisoning from undercooked meat. You don’t see a lion checking to make sure their dinner is cooked through all the way to the middle. You also don’t see a lion being picky about which part of an animal they should eat, but how often do we see stories in the newspaper of the shocking revelation that a brain was found in a piece of KFC? It’s like for that split second the illusion that meat doesn’t come from a living, breathing, feeling animal is shattered and people are forced to confront the abject reality of where their food comes from. A real omnivore isn’t disgusted by the gore. Let’s consider this, if you were locked in a room with a live chicken and an apple you would always eat the apple first. Because when we see a living being we don’t feel hungry, we don’t want to ravage animals and tear them apart - but when we see an apple we do feel hungry. Furthermore, even though certain animals eat other animals, there are many more herbivorous animals than there are carnivorous ones. But regardless, what exactly is the relevance of what other animals do when applied to human behaviour? Some animals rape and kill each other, so does that mean humans would be excused if they committed these acts too? Ask that question to the non-vegan who is using the excuse, say “wild animals kill each other, does that mean it is morally justifiable for humans to kill each other just because some wild animals do?”. Furthermore, lions have been documented killing their own cubs before, so using non-vegan logic it must therefore be acceptable for humans to kill their children as other animals have been shown to do so. In this situation ask the non-vegan “do you think it is wise to base our morality on that of a wild animal?”. Animals also kill their food themselves, they don’t pay others to kill on their behalf because they find the prospect of slaughtering an animal too traumatising. If we were naturally designed to eat meat we would have no objection to killing animals. We also wouldn’t shelter the truth from our children and yet we deem the reality of slaughterhouses to be too troubling and disturbing for a child. Other animals kill out of necessity whereas humans do not, in fact eating animals is incredibly detrimental to our health. Humans kill other animals because we enjoy the way they taste, meaning we kill them for pleasure, even though this goes against many of our core morals. Many of us oppose animal exploitation when it comes to things like dog fighting or hunting as they are seen as unnecessary and only done for pleasure and yet can’t see that eating animals is also unnecessary and only done for pleasure. It’s important to try and get people to make this connection so you can also ask the non-vegan “are you an obligate carnivore?” and then say “if you don’t have to eat meat then why do you do so?”. If they say it’s because they like the taste, then ask “are your tastebuds more important than a life?”. As you can see, the circle of excuses tends to go round like a revolving door! It is so unbelievably ironic that we deem ourselves so incredibly superior to animals (see intelligence), but when the superiority argument no longer functions as an effective excuse for murdering living beings, we suddenly portray ourselves as just a wild animal acting out our primal instincts. So what are we, better than animals, or only animals? We can’t be both.
