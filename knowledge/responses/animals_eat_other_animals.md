When confronted with the idea that the consumption of animals is done purely for the taste rather than for nutrition (see nutrition) one of the most common excuses vegans hear is, “but animals eat other animals, so why shouldn’t we?” As much as this may be true, some animals do indeed eat other animals, there’s several reasons as to why this statement holds no veracity whatsoever. 

What exactly is the relevance of what other animals do when applied to human behaviour? Some animals rape[1] and kill each other, so does that mean humans would be excused if they committed these acts too? Lions have been documented killing their own cubs before[3], so using the same logic it must therefore be acceptable for humans to kill their children as other animals have been shown to do so. Is it wise to base our morality on that of a wild animal?. 

Furthermore, other animals kill out of necessity whereas humans do not, in fact eating animals is incredibly detrimental to our health [2,4,5,6,7,8]. Humans kill other animals because we enjoy the way they taste, meaning we kill them for pleasure, even though this goes against many of our core morals to reduce unnecessary suffering. 

Many of us oppose animal exploitation when it comes to things like dog fighting or hunting as they are seen as unnecessary and only done for pleasure and yet can’t see that eating animals is also unnecessary and only done for pleasure.
