One of the most worrying aspects of this excuse is that if everyone had this attitude absolutely nothing would ever get done. Imagine if Mandela, Rosa Parks or Martin Luther King had said “but one person can’t make a difference.”. Of course one person can make a difference. In fact, sometimes it only takes one person to make a difference and to inspire a thousand minds. A movement is always made up of individuals and it’s the cumulative effort of these individuals that creates change. In America 400 million less animals were killed in 2014 compared to 2007 and it is estimated that the average person eats around 7,000 animals in their lifetime, which proves that every single day you live vegan you do make a massive difference. It really comes down to the idea of supply and demand, every time we buy a vegan product we are changing what is being demanded and voting with our wallet for the kind of world that we want to create. As more and more people demand vegan options, more and more vegan options will be produced, this is already happening! This is exactly why there is now vegan cheeses in mainstream supermarkets and vegan menus in high street restaurants. There is no denying that this movement is growing exponentially and this is because thousands of individuals are looking at their own actions and making the switch to veganism. After all, we are morally accountable for the actions that we make as individuals and regardless of what other people are doing, we have a responsibility to address the impact of our own actions and assess whether or not our lifestyle choices need to be changed. By going vegan you’re fiercely stating “not in my name” to the industries that use and kill animals. If everyone had always had the attitude “one person can’t make a difference”, then we would still have slavery and apartheid. It’s precisely because individuals, who at that time represented the minority, stood up and spoke out against these injustices that progress was made. It’s now up to us to do the same in order to save the animals, the planet and indeed ourselves.
