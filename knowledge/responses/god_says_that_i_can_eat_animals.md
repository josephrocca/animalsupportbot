No religious doctrine mandates eating animals. Religion doesn’t provide a necessity for us to exploit animals and as such, it still remains unnecessary and impossible to morally justify. It is plausible that animals during the time of Jesus Christ had to be eaten to survive. However, given our progress as a society and the plentitude of food available today, isn’t it more sensible that an all-loving God prefers humans to not kill his creatures, especially if it was not necessary for our survival?

When people use a belief to condemn an animal to a life of suffering and pain, it does not come close to making that action moral. Using a religious belief to justify killing animals is exactly the same as using a religious belief to oppress homosexuals or women.

If one believes that God created the planet and all of its creatures, it seems nonsensical that we are destroying so much life on this planet, namely by driving animals to extinction[1] and killing them by the trillions[2]. By consuming animals, humans have intervened with the natural order of how animals live. We have genetically modified these creatures[3], diverted the milk from female cows meant for their children, and forcibly impregnated creatures only to take their babies away from them[4].

Religious texts are often ambiguous and open to interpretation, which is partly why some Christians differ in their stance on homosexuality. This same ambiguity can also be seen when turning to the Bible for moral guidance on whether or not we should eat animal products. However, there are a multitude of passages from the Bible[5], and many other religious teachings, that reinforce the idea that no religion mandates the exploitation or consumption of animals.

Perhaps a simpler question is to ask: do slaughterhouses look like the work of God or the Devil? Hell is described as a place of eternal suffering, torment, and pain. For the animals, a slaughterhouse is indeed hell, and it is hard to imagine that a benevolent God could ever condone the sheer violence and terror within their walls.
