Do animals feel pain? Short answer: Yes, almost certainly [1,2,3,4].

Despite the fact that animals cannot explicitly verbalize the experience of pain through language, this does necessarily not exclude them from the experience of it. In the same way that human patients who are unable for whatever reason to say "I am in pain", they clearly still have the capacity to experience pain and suffering. 

While it is understandable that "the less similar the animal to a human and the less complex it is, the more difficult is the assessment [of experiencing pain]"[2], there are several indicators which are well studied supporting the experience of pain in animals (particularly vertebrates).

One such indicator is **"the discrimination of painful states"** [5]:

>In such experiments, rats show by shifting their operant response for food that they are able to distinguish injections of aspirin from injections of saline; furthermore, rats with arthritis learn this distinction more readily than do control rats (Weissman 1976; see also Colpaert 1978 and Swedberg et al. 1988). Thus, pain can serve as a discriminative stimulus, something the committee does not believe could occur without awareness.

Another indicator is the **"motivations to avoid pain or noxious stimuli"** [5]:

>In learning paradigms in which an operant delivers an analgesic, rats in models-of-pain experiments lever press to self-medicate, and at a much higher rate than control animals. For example, rats with ligated spinal nerves lever press for clonidine, while controls do not (Martin et al. 2006). Rats, mice, primates, and pigeons also lever press to avoid electric shock (which may be painful depending on its intensity and duration; cf. Carlsson et al. 2006). Furthermore, oral self-administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is observed in lame (i.e., arthritic) rats and chickens but not in their healthy counterparts (Colpaert et al. 1980; Danbury et al. 2000).

Together, "evidence for the conscious experience of pain is strong for mammals and birds"[5], and for fish and crustaceans, there is also strong evidence that they posess the necessary capacity to feel pain [6,7]. For a more detailed overview, including more nuance as to these indicators, I highly recommend reading a general overview, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_animals).

All this evidence does not even touch the core reason why many people intuitively believe that animals feel pain: **empathy**. If most people believed animals could not feel pain, would there be any support for animal abuse laws? Would you see the kind of vitriolic responses seen online from redditors when footage of dog or cat abuse is posted? It is hard to argue that we as a society should act on the assumption that animals don't feel pain, when the cost of being wrong is so high - should we allow pet owners to abuse and treat their animals unless there is "harder" proof of the experience of pain?

The answer to these is that most people do extend the benefit of the doubt towards animals feeling pain and suffering, and thus should take action to avoid causing it, particularly when it comes to domesticated animals. Veganism as an ideology simply asks to extend this philosophy to all animals and sentient beings.
