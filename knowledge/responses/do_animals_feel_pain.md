Continuing on from the excuse “plants feel pain”, I think it is also important to discuss whether or not animals feel pain, or at least do they feel pain the same as humans, as people do sometimes question this. In fact, I’ve even been told before that non-human animals don’t have brains, which is frightening to hear that people actually think that. We’ve had laws in place for a long time that require that we treat animals “humanely”, now these are quite obviously ineffective, however the point is that we do recognise that if we abuse let’s say a dog, we will be punished for doing so because we understand that the dog feels pain and has the capacity to suffer. If we draw comparisons to the plants feel pain argument, we don’t have any laws forbidding me from going out onto the street and pulling all the petals off a daisy. Another example would be the way that we slaughter animals, now obviously we all recognise that what happens in slaughterhouses is anything but humane - humane slaughter, after all, is an oxymoron. It can never exist. However, what’s important to note is that we do have methods in place that are there to supposedly reduce the suffering of the animals that we kill, the reason that this is important is because that means we acknowledge as a society that the animals we kill have the ability to feel pain and suffer. From a science perspective, non-human animals have the same or at least almost identical areas of the brain involved in processing pain and show similar pain behaviours to humans. When our companion animals are in pain they act correspondingly, showing unusual behavioural traits like rocking back and forth, emitting distress calls and changes in the rate and depth of breathing, such as panting. Humans in pain also display these behaviours. Many non-vegans think that fish don’t feel pain, however fish are scientifically proven to feel pain and have also been shown to adopt uncharacteristic behaviours in situations that provoke pain. Furthermore fish have sensory neurons that are physiologically identical to humans. In fact when morphine has been administered to fish showcasing pain, their symptoms and responses disappeared, like they do in humans. Sentient beings need to be able to feel pain in order to survive as it allows them to escape from dangerous situations and minimise potential injury. So let’s broaden the argument and encapsulate emotional pain into the excuse. We have established that animals feel physical pain but it is also well documented that they experience emotional suffering just like us humans do. Mother cows mourn the kidnapping of their babies by crying for hours, orcas as well have been shown to mourn the kidnapping of their offspring and animals such as dogs have been shown to suffer from separation anxiety when their companion human leaves them on their own. So now that we have established that animals feel both physical and emotional pain, the question becomes but do they feel pain as much as humans do? There seems to be an idea, an ignorant but nonetheless commonly accepted idea, that humans are more capable of suffering because we deem ourselves to be more intellectually sophisticated. There is however no evidence to support the argument that we suffer greater than non-human animals - and in fact it is plausible that it would be more correct to assume the opposite of this. If we compare the suffering that say a dog would go through breaking their leg, compared to the suffering a human would go through, it could be argued that a dog would suffer more because of certain cognitive differences. A human would know what the problem was and would know that it could be easily treated and that the pain will end. A dog on the other hand wouldn’t understand what had happened in the same way and would be greatly confused by the pain and wouldn’t have the same understanding that the pain will at some point end, arguably making their experience of the same event worse. But really it is entirely irrelevant the degree of pain an animal feels, it could be more than humans, it could be less. We all feel different degrees of pain but that realisation doesn’t justify inflicting unnecessary pain. You might feel less pain than I do but it wouldn’t then be acceptable for me to intentionally harm you. It doesn’t matter what experience of pain you have only that you are capable of having a feeling that you don’t want to have. The same applies to animals, the fact that they can experience pain means that they have a preference to avoid it and by default, it is our moral obligation to ensure no unnecessary pain is caused to any living creature.
