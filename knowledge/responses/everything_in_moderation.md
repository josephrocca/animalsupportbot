Veganism seems to be the only social justice movement where people try and incorporate the idea of moderation or reducing as a viable solution. We would never consider it acceptable for a racist to simply reduce how much they were racist, or for a misogynist to simply reduce how often they oppress women. The reality is, it doesn’t matter how much or how little someone does these things, there is still a victim who is being impacted.

This is why it is not morally justifiable to only reduce the amount of animal products we consume, as even if it is ‘only’ once a week there is still a victim who is being negatively impacted for an unnecessary reason, this is precisely why moderation or reduction is not an ethical compromise, because it means nothing to the animal who is still being exploited and killed. 

Claiming that eating flesh or animal products in moderation is ethically responsible validates the idea that using animals is normal and morally admissible. No animal that gets murdered is grateful because the person that eats their flesh believes they do so in moderation. The animal is still dead, their life is still over and no amount of moderation or reduction changes that fact.
