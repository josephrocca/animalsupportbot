I’m tying in the “everything in moderation” argument with the idea of Meatless Mondays as both support the idea that reducing animal product consumption makes it both healthy and ethical. Let’s start with the health argument, when people say “everything in moderation”, or “a little bit of cheese or meat is healthy”, I normally respond by saying, “If something is bad for you, it’s bad for you. It doesn’t matter if you consume a lot or a little, it’s still bad for you. Now, you could smoke one cigarette a month and it wouldn’t give you cancer or kill you but that cigarette is still bad for you. Likewise, you could eat a slice of bacon once a month and although it wouldn’t kill you, it is still inherently bad for you.”. You could then go on to say, “the great thing about plants is they contain all the good nutrients and vitamins associated with animal products but they don’t come with all the incredibly unhealthy aspects like cholesterol, trans fat, hormones, antibiotics, etc.”. Now let’s turn our attention to the ethical implications of this argument. Veganism is the only social justice movement where people try and incorporate the idea of moderation or reducing as a viable solution. We would never consider it acceptable for a racist to simply reduce how much they were racist, or for a misogynist to simply reduce how often they oppress women. The reality is, it doesn’t matter how much or how little someone does these things, there is still a victim who is being impacted. This is why it is not morally justifiable to only reduce the amount of animal products we consume, as even if it is ‘only’ once a week there is still a victim who is being negatively impacted for an unnecessary reason, this is precisely why moderation or reduction is not an ethical compromise, because it means nothing to the animal who is still being exploited and killed. Claiming that eating flesh or animal products in moderation is ethically responsible validates the idea that using animals is normal and morally admissible. Let’s put this into perspective, most people who claim “everything in moderation” normally have a diet that consists of cow’s milk on their cereal and morning coffee, followed by a ham and cheese sandwich or something along those lines for lunch and probably another coffee with cow’s milk during the day. For dinner it will be cow flesh, or chicken flesh, or pig flesh, maybe some roast potatoes cooked in an animal’s fat. Afterwards it could be a dairy desert and then not to mention the snacks and biscuits that have dairy butter in them or the chocolate bars that have even more cow’s milk in. This diet resembles anything but moderation but this is the sort of diet that the majority of people in the UK consume on a daily basis. To bring this discussion back to the ethical side of the moderation argument, animals are still being murdered for no justifiable reason. No animal that gets murdered is grateful because the person that eats their flesh believes they do so in moderation. The animal is still dead, their life is still over and no amount of moderation or reduction changes that fact. If you are having a conversation with someone and they try to morally justify eating animal products by saying they do so in moderation or claim that they have reduced their consumption, ask them why. If they mention that it’s for ethical or environmental reasons then I think it’s important to praise them for reducing their consumption but at the same time don’t enable it and make sure to highlight how morally that still isn’t acceptable or good enough. Say something like “it’s great that you have reduced your animal product consumption for ethical reasons, but have you thought about how even though you may not be consuming as much as you used to, you are still paying for animals to be exploited and ultimately slaughtered?”.
