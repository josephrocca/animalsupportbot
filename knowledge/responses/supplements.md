Supplementation does not necessarily mean one's diet is inadequate. If supplementation signifies a poor diet and meat-eating is so healthy, why are most grocery stores packed wall to wall with supplements? Take a look at [this](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/vitamin-supplement-aisle-walmart-superstore-orlando-fl-usa-variety-supplemental-pill-capsule-products-172155507.jpg) picture for reference. It would be inaccurate to say supplements exist only for vegans, considering that various supplements contain animal products. Think of supplementation as a safety net, sort of like insurance for the body. Ensuring one gets all the vitamins and minerals needed by the body for healthy living should be of interest to everyone!

Most people do not even realize that the foods they eat are likely to be fortified with vitamins and minerals. Claiming that veganism is unhealthy because it requires supplementation is ridiculous because omnivores consume it without even realizing it. Let's take a look at a few examples.
Taken directly from the [Borden](https://www.bordendairy.com/product/2-percent-reduced-fat-milk/) website, the 2% reduced-fat milk lists Vitamin A and Vitamin D3 as fortifications. Even organic kinds of milk like [Horizon](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/e1654cef-6493-461b-850c-8f3aa94cf36b.ed0f6133a50fb81912cfd9ab8490e229.jpeg?odnWidth=undefined&odnHeight=undefined&odnBg=ffffff) add Vitamin D3 and DHA algal oil to their milk. Cereals like [Honey Bunches of Oats
With Almonds](https://www.honeybunchesofoats.com/products/with-almonds/) are fortified with Iron, Vitamin B3, Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, Zinc Oxide, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin B12. Most staple foods are fortified or enriched with vitamins and minerals like juices, yogurts, bread, cereals, eggs, milk, milk alternatives, and even salt. This excerpt is taken directly from the CDC website on mandatory fortification of specific foods: ["Mandatory fortification requires food manufacturers to add certain vitamins or minerals, or both, to specified foods. Mandatory fortification is done to address a significant public health need. For example, in the 1940s, the FDA required addition of several B vitamins—thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin—to flour to eliminate these vitamin deficiencies in the U.S. population. In 1998, the FDA required that the B vitamin, folic acid, be added to enriched cereal grain products to reduce the risk of neural tube defects."](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/faqs/faqs-fortification.html#:~:text=Mandatory%20fortification%20requires%20food%20manufacturers,a%20significant%20public%20health%20need.) 

Typical arguments against veganism almost always mention Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 does not naturally occur in animal flesh. In fact, it is not made by plants or animals at all. Vitamin B12 is made by bacteria, found in soil and water. Through sanitation practices in produce and our water supply, it has become practically impossible to find B12 naturally. Most farmed animals are given vitamins through their food or through direct injections. In other words, animals recycle the vitamins and pass them through their flesh and secretions. So yes, animal flesh does contain B12, but so do many vegan products as well. Foods commonly fortified with B12 are nutritional yeast, plant-based milk, tempeh, fortified cereals, seaweed, and certain fungi. Absorption of B12 is a problem for both omnivores and vegans as it becomes more difficult to absorb as we age. This means we need to consume more to receive the same effect. Put simply, even meat-eaters can suffer from Vitamin B12 deficiencies so supplementing with an oral vitamin or monthly injection can prove to be beneficial to one's health.
