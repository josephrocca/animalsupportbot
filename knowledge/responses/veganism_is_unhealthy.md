Hearing that we need to eat animal products in order to be healthy is a very frustrating excuse for a vegan to hear, after all, vegans are living evidence that this simply isn’t true. However the majority of people truly believe that animal products contain nutritional elements that we cannot get elsewhere and that we need for our health and longevity, after all, there has to be a real reason why we’re doing all of these horrific things to animals, right? 

The main nutritional factors that come up in conversations with non-vegans are protein, iron, calcium, and B12. The American Dietetic Association and the British Dietetic Association, the largest bodies of nutrition and diet professionals in both countries, have both stated that a plant-based (vegan) diet is nutritionally adequate and safe for all stages of life, including pregnancy [1].

The scientific consensus is that we can officially get all the nutrients we need without eating animals or their secretions. Protein, iron, calcium and every other nutrient that we associate with animal products can be obtained easily without the need for exploiting animals. The largest and strongest land animals in the world, the elephant, the rhino, the hippopotamus, what do they all have in common? They are all plant eaters. But does anyone think an elephant is protein deficient, or that a rhino has weak bones? 

What about a gorilla, humans share approximately 98% of our DNA with gorillas and they are herbivorous. But how many protein deficient gorillas do we see? Why would animals that have almost the same DNA as us but that are also much stronger than we are, be able to get all the nutrients they need from plants, if we humans can’t? In fact, consuming animal products has been linked to our top diseases and illnesses. Heart disease[2], type-2 diabetes[3], many forms of cancer[4], strokes[5], and hypertension[6] have all been inextricably linked to the consumption of animal products and many of them can be treated and even reversed by switching to a plant- based lifestyle. 

There are an abundance of plant-based athletes across the world including Germany’s strongest man Patrick Baboumian, NFL players such as David Carter and weightlifters such as Kendrick Farris and boxers like David Haye. In the face of such prominent counter-examples, does this not therefore mean that doing these things to animals is an act of unnecessary cruelty?
