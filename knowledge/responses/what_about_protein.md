One of the most prevalent myths on veganism is that vegan diets are lacking in enough protein to be healthy, and the only way to get healthy amounts of protein naturally is through the consumption of meat, dairy, and/or eggs. This common myth has existed for a long time, but is based on flawed logic, misguided understanding of nutrition, and a disregard of plentiful evidence to the contrary.

To start, there are several athletes who have sustained or increased their performances under vegan diets. Several athletic and strength world record holders completed their records as vegans, and more athletes, powerlifters, and bodybuilders are seeing continued improvements after switching to a vegan diet. This helps prove that **a pure vegan diet can allow enough protein to maintain an athletic lifestyle.** Although some people would point out that these athletes only get enough protein by supplementing it, it is important to note that supplements are nothing new for athletes. To the average person it can seem unnecessary to convert to a plant based diet just to resort to supplements, and it is true that this would be inconvenient, but in reality, vegan athletes supplement because they are athletes, not because they are vegan. All athletes supplement. For the average person **a proper vegan diet would not necessitate protein supplementation.**

A lot of us have been conditioned to think protein and animals are inseparable for so long that it is easy to miss out on the protein that's readily available in virtually all plant based sources. Although eating complimentary foods together can grant a complete protein, such as beans and rice, **several whole plant food sources have a complete amino acid profile all on their own.** Such foods include: quinoa, buckwheat, soy, various types of seeds, and more. Just looking at the amino acid profiles of many popular whole plant foods gives a clear view of readily available protein in vegan diets.

To counter the claim that there is an inefficient amount of protein in a vegan diet, it is pertinent to include areas where **a non-vegan diet can actually cause a reduction in protein intake.** One such area, which reduces the liver's protein production, is inflammation. **Inflammation can lower protein levels** because of albumin, a negative acute phase protein. When inflammation occurs, the liver, which produces albumin, must shift from that albumin production to the production of C reactive proteins, which are positive acute phase proteins, to fight the inflammation. **Not only do vegans have lower C reactive protein risk, but when non-vegans are put on a vegan diet, their C reactive protein levels can lower by one third.** This all results in higher levels of available blood protein for someone on a whole plant based diet because a lot of animal products and processed foods increases risk of inflammation, which forces the liver to shift from general protein production to inflammation specific proteins. Although this is just an example, it showcases how **a diet centered around animals, which is often synonymous with protein itself, can actually cause issues with a reduction of total protein levels, not increase it.**

The overall take from all this is that **animals are not a required source of protein.** A plant based diet can have enough protein for any requirement someone may have, and a whole plant food diet can even be more beneficial to protein levels compared to a diet focused on meat or processed foods. Although some research may be needed for individuals with high protein needs, animals are ultimately unneeded, and **the average person will not need to supplement protein, or have protein deficiencies, if they base their diet on whole plant sources.**
