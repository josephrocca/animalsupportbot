The myth that it is impossible or difficult to consume enough protein in vegan diets is incorrect. It is a long standing misconception that stems from a lack of understanding of science and nutrition.

To start, there are several athletes who have sustained or increased their performances under vegan diets. Several athletic and strength world record holders completed their records as vegans, and more athletes, powerlifters, and bodybuilders are seeing continued improvements after switching to a vegan diet [1], proving that a vegan diet provides sufficient protein to maintain an athletic lifestyle. Although some may point out that these athletes only get enough protein through supplementaiton, it is important to note that supplements are nothing new for athletes. In reality, vegan athletes supplement because they are athletes, not because they are vegan. All athletes supplement [2]. For the average person, a proper vegan diet would not necessitate protein supplementation.

A lot of us have been conditioned to think protein and animals are inseparable for so long that it is easy to miss out on the protein that's readily available in virtually all plant-based sources. Although eating complementary foods together can grant a complete protein, such as beans and rice, several whole plant food sources have a complete amino acid profile all on their own. Such foods include: quinoa, buckwheat, soy, various types of seeds, and more [3]. Looking at the amino acid profiles of many whole plant foods gives a clear view of readily available protein in vegan diets.

To counter the claim that there is an inefficient amount of protein in a vegan diet, it is pertinent to include areas where a non-vegan diet can actually cause a reduction in protein intake. One such area, which reduces the liver's protein production, is inflammation. Inflammation can lower protein levels because of albumin, a negative acute phase protein. When inflammation occurs, the liver, which produces albumin, must shift from that albumin production to the production of C reactive proteins, which are positive acute phase proteins, to fight the inflammation.[4] Not only do vegans have lower C reactive protein risk, but when non-vegans are put on a vegan diet, their C reactive protein levels can lower by one-third [5]. This results in higher levels of available blood protein for someone on a whole plant-based diet because a lot of animal products and processed foods increases risk of inflammation [4], which forces the liver to shift from general protein production to inflammation of specific proteins. Although this is just an example, it showcases how a diet centered around animals, which is often synonymous with protein itself, can actually cause issues with a reduction of total protein levels, not increase it [4].

The overall take from all this is that animals are not a required source of protein. A plant-based diet can have sufficient protein, and a whole food plant-based diet can be even more beneficial for protein levels compared to a diet focused on meat or processed foods [6]. Although some research may be needed for individuals with high protein needs, animals are ultimately unneeded, and the average person will not need to supplement protein, or have protein deficiencies, if they base their diet on whole plant sources.
