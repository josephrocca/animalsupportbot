examples:
- it's hard to be vegan
- it's not part of my culture
- I can't be vegan because I'm gluten intolerant
- I can't be vegan because I'm allergic
- I can't be vegan because I'm neurodivergent
- neurodivergent people can't go vegan
- gluten intolerant people can't go vegan
- what about neurodivergent people
- what about gluten intolerant people 
- vegans are ableist
- Just being able to eat whatever I want is pretty awesome.
- Being able to eat out anywhere, charcuterie, trying local foods while traveling
- Being able to go to any restaurant and know I can eat basically anything there, no issue.
- Not having to tell my kids at social gatherings that there are so many things they can't eat and dealing with the complaining and trying to not have other people notice.
- Not having to think about food constantly (not just is this vegan, but because I was hungry!). It was draining. Now I eat everything.
- It takes a lot of effort to have a healthy vegan diet
