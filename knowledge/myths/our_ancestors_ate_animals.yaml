examples:
- our ancestors ate meat
- cavemen ate animals
- cavemen ate meat
- neanderthals ate meat
- primordial humans ate meat
- our ancestors wouldn't have survived without hunting and eating meat
- we've always eaten animals
- ancestors
- Vegans must not believe that their ancestors only ate meat amirite
- The cave paintings are overwhelming evidence that humans were predators. All of the prehistoric cave paintings found around the world are identical, they depict prey and rival predators in that specific environment. They even sometimes depict hunting methods with spears and ropes, with special markings on the animal that depict where the vital organs are for spear thrusting, as an educational tool for young hunters.
- Millions of years of evolution screaming at us to thrive and out-compete just like every other animal, but these vegan fucking tools have managed to throw all of that out the window in favour of the fanatical, overly emotional moralizing bullshit.
- I have been reading up on ancient diets, especially Norway, Sweden. Mostly they didn't eat vegetables and most fruits (some wild berries in the summer) because it was to damn cold to grow them.
- "Ancestors: no domesticated plants, guess I'm gonna starve"
- Yeah omnivorism and meat cooking was what made us human
- If we didn't eat meat all those millions of years then humanity wouldn't even exist to this day.
- We have to eat animals because it's part of human nature and we have been doing it since we evolved.
