examples:
- factory farming is the main culprit
- I only eat free range
- I only eat organic
- Humanely treated, grass-fed, organic , and ideally locally-sourced meat is best.
- It absolutely doesn't have to be the case and if anything, the best tasting meat is raised more humanely (they don't get the cortisol surge before slaughter).
- As long as the butchers treat the animals with respect i don't see the problem
- To be fair, there is mistreatment of animals in some factory farming settings. But for the most part it is fine.
- I buy raw whole milk from a little dairy farm. We use the cream for making butter, coffee, we whip it for deserts etc. costs me 4$ a gallon which is only 1.50$ extra. I can't have processed milk but I can get raw milk, bring it home and separate it and be just fine. I know the dairy cows are being treated well (those cows are spoilt as shit
-  Even when I tell them I am actively centering my life around 100% abstaining from factory farming, going so far as to raise my own livestock to my personal code of ethics, they still don't think it's good enough.
- You really can taste good healthy happy animals
