- "What about babies isn\u2019t it child abuse to force your children to be vegan?\n"
- Children should be given the choice to eat meat
- It is child abuse to force your child to be vegan
- Forcing your child to be vegan is no different from refusing blood transfusions
- Children should not be vegan, it is crucial for their development
- vegan baby food should be considered cruelty too (not the ones that don't harm, but it's dumb as fuck to make someone vegan when they don't even have teeth yet)
- If you're going to do it, don't force your kids to become vegan.
- Everyone in the hospital I work at agreed with me that vegan diets are not suitable for children.
- Like when people won't feed their child milk or other essential things, glad I ain't this unfortunate
- This is why vegans shouldn't raise children because they can't see the difference between an animal and their offspring
