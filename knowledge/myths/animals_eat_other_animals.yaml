- All the cats and dogs I've had never turned down milk or cheese or butter. Explain that.
- Wait till they find out that fish are cannibals!
- Inherently different species have the right, if not the responsibility, to actively compete and kill one another. It's how nature works.
- There's plenty of videos of predators eating animals as they are being born
- Have you ever seen mantises? Oh god, those things eat everything alive; insect, lizard, frog...

- Plants eat meat too
- They'd eat me too, if they could.
