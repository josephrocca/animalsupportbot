examples:
- humans are the superior species
- humans are the most evolved
- we deserve to eat animals
- we deserve to eat them
- humans deserve to eat them
- humans are the apex predator
- They are fullfilling the natural purpose of their lives by contributing to the food
  chain
- Humans are superior to animals, therefore it's okay to eat animals.
- Until an animal overtakes us in the food chain, they're all ready to be shot and eaten (or bolt-gunned and eaten).
- But I believe in an ethical hierarchy with humans being at top
- They are just assuming. If we didn't have animals, there beloved plants wouldn't grow, it's the natural food chain
- The lower orders of life are eaten by the higher.
- PETA calls us speciest when we eat animals because it's part of the fucking food chain
- humans superior to other animals, and created other animals for the purpose of the food chain. We are on the top, so we have every right to eat animals.
- we be at the top of da food chain
- We on the other are the highest form of life which is why we should lower ourselves back to the bottom of the food chain!
- humans are the highest form of life in the food chain
