examples:
- animals are stupid
- cows are dumb
- chickens are dumb
- pigs are dumb
- animals are dumb as hell
- chickens are so dumb they deserve to be eaten
- we are smarter than animals and deserve to eat them
- humans are just smarter than animals, that's why we eat them
- Pigs are clever, but there probably isn't much, if any, meta-cognition going on. They're not aware of their own mortality. They're certainly capable of perceiving pain. Any animal is. But pain perception is not the same as suffering.    There probably isn't an awareness in the pig thinking, "Uh, this sucks. I wish I wasn't experiencing this."    Humans and other apes, dolphins and maybe elephants are probably the only animals capable of this level of cognition.
- We're also the only species that uses grocery stores, clothing or houses   And cars, are you ready to say bye bye to your minivan Karen?
- This week someone tried to tell me chickens are intelligent and have a "sense of self" because apparently they like looking in mirrors.
- The absolute lack of hesitation and reliance on instinct makes me question if these animals have even low grade ~~intelligence~~ sentience or are effectively biological robots.
- Look at it's eyes..and you can clearly see not much is going on in the intelligence department,
- They inject human thoughts, wishes, and wants on animals... when Animals aren't really that complex. All they want is a warm place to sleep, food to eat, and a safe place to raise their young. They know naught of morality.
- Chickens don't have free will.
- Chickens do not have free will and cannot sign things they agree with, this is idiotic. Placing them on the same pedestal as a human is also idiotic, makes no sense to personify animals like that.
- NO THEY ARE NOT I HAVE OWNED PIGS BEFORE THEY ARE SOME OF THE DUMBEST ANIMALS I HAVE EVER SEEN
