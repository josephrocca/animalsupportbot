examples:
- what would happen to the animals
- there would be too many animals if we stopped eating them
- "Do you want the cows to take over the earth?"
- the world would be overpopulated with animals if we didn't eat them
- Most livestock animals would not survive in the wild and thus wouldn't even exist if it weren't for agriculture.
- So without humans there will be an absolute overload of animals, which will end up dying of starvation
- in fact if we stop eating meat, there will be WAYY more methane (which is a huge contributor to global warming) going into the ozone layer because there are way more cows and pigs.
- Like legit. If sheep never get sheared their wool will turn out like that. It's better for them to get sheared. Same goes for cows. Its bad for cows not to get milked.
- who tf will be around to take care of the animals then?
