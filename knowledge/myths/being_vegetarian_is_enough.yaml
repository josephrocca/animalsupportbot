examples:
- I'm vegetarian
- eggs and cheese aren't so bad
- dairy is fine
- it doesn't make sense to give up dairy and eggs
- You don't have to kill a cow to get milk
- eating eggs and milk are fine as the animals don't die
- Eggs, milk...     You don't even have to kill the animal for those...
- I love all animals, constantly being told that I'm not doing well enough as a vegetarian is hard.
