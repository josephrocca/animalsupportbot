examples:
- desert island
- survival situation
- in a survival situation you would eat meat
- what if vegans were stranded in the wilderness with only animals to eat
- you better believe vegans would still kill animals if they needed to survive
- I wanna see how vegans die in the wild, or anywhere else.
- Vegans would be dead a day before modernity
