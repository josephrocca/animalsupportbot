examples:
- meat is a big part of my culture
- what about the culture around food
- my culture revolves around eating meat
- tradition
- culture
- We have cataloged our drinking of milk for a really long time
- Humans eat meat and always have.
- Lol. Humans have been eating meat for eons by now. Imagine spouting vegan bs 10 000 years ago. You wouldn't be exactly welcomed back.
- We just had EID (islamic yearly festival) and its customary to offer sacrifices i.e goats,sheep,cows & camels We share the meat around our communities from the poor to the rich everyone enjoys some juicy tasty meat.
- Similar to how in America where a lot of people celebrate Christmas as a secular holiday it'd be cool if there would be something like EID where Americans from all sorts of backgrounds can help feed the poor by peacefully killing animals in a celebratory manner. I'd love to learn to ritualistically and painlessly learn to slaughter animals so I could feed the poor.
- Those Inuit kids look happy making their ancestors proud keeping their culture alive
- i like how there like yea we can just stop 5,000 years of tradition 
- The majority of vegans on social media I have seen travel strictly for the scenery and live quite strictly as outsiders.  It's very rare a vegan will stay with a host family and try to understand their culture.   It's very hard to stay vegan when say, an impoverished host family in Africa slaughters and lovingly prepares their prized and beloved goat just for you to honor you as a guest.
- Imagine cajun food with no animal products?
- I'm Greek my parents came over from Greece in the 50s every meal my mother cooked meat was the focus pork, lamb, beef, hamburger, fish we had potatoes and bread
