examples:
- they wouldn't exist without us
- animals wouldn't exist without us
- "The cows are grass fed and live a proper life. They have all the space they need. They also get sustainable food."
- treated farm animals live better lives
- We kill the animals before eating them Wild animals eat them while they're alive and struggling
- I would much prefer to have a decent life on a humane farm followed by a quick death leaving a useful body behind than be a wild animal or rot away in a sanctuary.
- Yeah, really cattle live better lives than most animals. Not quite on the level of a pet, but they do get similar benefits. Not constantly having to worry about survival, a quick and painless death. It ain't a bad deal, especially considering what is humans get out of it.
- Farm animals and humans live in a symbiotic relationship, as the animals live a safe life including medical help, but pay with their lives in the end.
- So, they know domestic sheep would suffer and die if we didn't use them for wool, right?
- Shearing sheep is wrong? But they love having all that thick wool removed during the hot summer months.
- Do they realise sheep being shorn has benefits to the sheep as well right?
- Farmers give animals better lives since in the wild they have to be hypervigilant and forage for their food
- lmao the animals they freed probably got eaten limb by limb by a pack of wolves later in the woods.
- Domesticated animals don't survive long in the wild. By trying to save the animals, they're killing them.
- "We're setting them free to live their natural life: being eaten by the first predator that comes along because they're domesticated animals that can't survive without human stewardship."
- Many farm animals have way better lives than they would 'au naturel'.
