examples:
- it's impossible to be fully vegan
- what about bugs and mice in crop fields
- vegans cause suffering too
- let's just not pretend veganism doesn't cause suffering
- you are still causing harm
- you can't live a life free from harm
- Veganism does not make you unreliant on animal agriculture.
- I have wondered about the use of animal byproducts in fertilizer production..is it significant and because of this are vegans indirectly consuming an diet dependent on animal agriculture
- the fact that so many field animals are killed each year for plant farming. Yet those deaths are seen as “acceptable” despite the obvious hypocrisy of such a stance.
- Think of the insects killed during farming.
- How many mental gymnastics do you have to do to consider that a bunch of mice dying in a thresher is NOT the same as a cow getting slaughtered? It's still animals getting killed for food...
- They think rabbits are cute but tons of them die for their veggies....
- Interesting so eating beef is the same as killing your dog, but pesticides are okay
- And if it only eats grass, look at all the small animals being saved from mono crop farming for plant based diet.
- Meanwhile thousands of rodents and millions of insects are being turned into a fine paste by combine harvesters. But they're small, so it obviously doesn't count!
- That's just weird. And someone should remind him that non meat eaters also contribute to animal death and suffering.
- most medicines have an animal origin, like the horseshoe crab
- We are vegans for enviromental reasons and then generates greenhouse gases to drive around announcing that.
- Their almond milk is killing bees
- Dear vegans, If this is your logic then stop washing your clothes, get rid of all of your electronics, get rid of all your cleaning supplies, stop recycling, and do not use any mode of transportation other then walking because if it was not for chemists you would not have any of these things.
- I sometimes have nightmares about the trillion zooplanktons that vegans kill every year to water their almonds,
- walking on grass they trampled thousands of bugs
- Everything humans do either hurts other humans, animals, or both. I think any vegan that says it's a cruelty free diet is lying to themselves,
