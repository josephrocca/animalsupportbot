examples:
- I love animals
- I'm an animal lover
- This actually made me feel a little bad for eating meat. I wouldn't not eat meat, just saying, the guy is cute.
- lol this drawing is so cute to me i think of chickens as cute no matter what, i also see them as food but i still think theyre cute
- I love them, alive AND on my plate :)
- You guys ever watch cute cow compilations on YouTube while eating a burger, just to flex on vegans?   Cows are adorable. They're basically big dogs. And that in no way, shape, or form prevents me from eating them.
- Why do brainless vegans think their stupid opinions matters? We eat meat when we want it, we watch cute animal videos when we like it. They stick their opinions into their ass where they belong.
- Why can't most vegans realize that you can love and respect animals while eating them?
- I can appreciate animals without having to recognize a right to life in them or equate their value to that of humans.
- They want to believe they're the only ones who care about animal welfare. They're wrong, ignore them. <3
