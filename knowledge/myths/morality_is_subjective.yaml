examples:
- morality is subjective
- morality is subjective anyways
- Pets, like cats and dogs, have different social statuses in most societies than livestock animals and killing is not considered intrinsically immoral but contextually immoral
- Vegans like to act like their pseudo-pacifistic animal loving philosophy has a monopoly on "ethics". Ethics essentially just means a set of beliefs governing actions.
- you can't fucking judge if veganism is right or wrong, whether you view killing animals for food or for fun is completely up to the person, not a universal thing
- Also, morality and ethics are humans constructs, build by humans for humans to live in society.
