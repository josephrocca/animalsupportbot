examples:
- what about slavery
- what about child labour
- vegans don't care about human rights
- vegans don't care about lgbt issues
- vegans don't care about any other issue
- why not dedicate this energy to solving more important things like racism, child labour
- there are more important things to fix than killing animals for food
- compare consuming animal products to sexual assault is just perverse
- compare eating a chicken nugget to owning a slave
- Vegans would rather humanize disabled animals than humanize disabled human beings but they aren't ready for that convo yet
- This is mildly disturbing. The fact she cares more about animals than those third world country child labour victims and government slaves who produce their almond milk and exotic fruits for year round consumption...
- They don't care about humans anyway, only about animals
- They are acting like being Vegan was the most important thing in the word.
- People that consider animals as important or even more important than human beings are just stupid naive overgrown children.
- Vegans care about animals more than about humans. Nothing new here.
- Lets defend animals but lets not defend those kids who made you T-shirt working for 1/10,000th of your wage in the worst condition being forced to by slave owners in dozens of countries.
- Can't imagine an impoverished person thinking the life of a chicken is of the same value of their own.
- Which is a common recurring theme I notice with vegans. They equate animals to human women.
- Your 12 year old cares about human rights and somehow this is a bad thing
- There are more important challenges to face in life.
- If I eat locally made cheese where the cows and workers have been treated well instead of making my own cashew cheese, as cashews are incredibly toxic to the workers that shell them, that's definitely more ethical.
