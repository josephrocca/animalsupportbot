examples:
- animals don't feel pain
- animals aren't sentient
- Fish dont have a complex nervous system compared to mammals and dont know whats happening so its fine to eat fish
- The absolute lack of hesitation and reliance on instinct makes me question if these animals have even low grade ~~intelligence~~ sentience or are effectively biological robots.
- Animals are just biological robots
- there is no evidence for any beings other than yourself being sentient
